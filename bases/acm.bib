abstract = {with the development of network technology, the number of network applications increases rapidly, public network protocols and private network protocols are booming, which puts forward higher requirements for the identification and analysis of network protocols. bitstream-oriented network protocol analysis is of great significance for network monitoring, network security and quality of service assurance. at present, most of the methods used in network protocol identification are highly targeted, and there are some limitations in the accuracy of known protocol identification, encrypted data identification, automatic mining of new protocol types and so on. this paper proposes BONPR (a bitstream oriented network protocol recognizer), which realizes known network protocol data recognition based on deep flow detection. a new run test method is used to test the randomness of the data, and the unknown protocol types are identified by data slicing and fixed position data statistics.finally the test data are constructed to prove the effectiveness of the system.},

abstract = {To ensure the security of data transmission on the Internet, users usually encrypt the data during the process of sending and receiving data. For example, the commonly used HTTPS protocol verifies the identity of servers through TLS certificates and encrypts communication between browsers and servers. However, the encrypted part of the unstructured data is still re-encrypted by TLS during HTTPS transmission, wasting computing and energy resources. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient network protocol, namely MRP, that avoids multiple encryption. MRP could carry multiple types of application layer protocols, while freely configure the location and encryption approaches of the data that needs to be encrypted. Based on our proposed, users could freely segment application layer data, achieve on-demand encryption of data, reduce encryption costs without compromising user security requirements, avoid redundant double encryption and save energy.},

abstract = {Detection of vehicles and their classification is a significant component of wide-area monitoring and surveillance, as well as intelligent- transportation. Existing solutions tend to employ heavy-weight infrastructure and costly equipment, as well as largely depend on constant support from the cloud through round-the-clock internet connectivity and uninterrupted power supply. Moreover, existing works mainly concentrate on localized measurement and do not discuss their efficient integration to address the problem over a wide area. For practical use in an outdoor environment, apart from being technically sound and accurate, a solution also needs to be cost-effective,lightweight,easy to install,flexible,low overhead, and easily maintainable, as well as self-sufficient as much as possible. However, fulfilling all these goals together is a challenging task. In this work, we propose an IoT-assisted strategy, LiVeR, to accomplish it. For self-sufficient on-the-fly classification in resource-constrained low-power IoT devices, LiVeR minimizes not only the computational requirements but also the energy consumption, which enables sustained operation in a hostile outdoor environment for a considerably long time solely based on battery power. Through extensive studies based on outdoor measurement and trace-based simulation on empirical data, we demonstrate that LiVeR classifies vehicles of small, medium, and large size with an accuracy of 91.3% up to 98.8%, 92.3% up to 98.5%, and 93.8% up to 98.8%, respectively, for single-lane traffic. We also demonstrate that LiVeR spends only about one-third of the number of RF packets to achieve vehicle detection and classification compared to the state-of-the-art RF-based solution, considerably extending the lifetime of the system.},

Our findings indicate that plain DoC is on par with common DNS solutions for the constrained IoT but significantly outperforms when additional standard features of CoAP are used such as caching. With OSCORE, we can save more than 10 kBytes of code memory compared to DTLS, when a CoAP application is already present, and retain the end-to-end trust chain with intermediate proxies, while leveraging features such as group communication or encrypted en-route caching. We also discuss a compression scheme for very restricted links that reduces data by up to 70%.},

We present Onyx, a system for meeting such requirements which uses many well-studied techniques in a new context as well as introduces new techniques that enable a scalable cloud financial exchange. An overlay multicast tree is used to disseminate data to 1000 participants with ≤ 1 μs difference in data reception time between any two participants, crucial for maintaining fair competition. Several techniques for mitigating latency variance are introduced. Onyx also presents a scheduling policy for trade orders that enhances an exchange's performance and gracefully services bursty traffic. Onyx achieves ≈50% lower latency than the AWS multicast service [1]. Onyx outperforms an existing system, CloudEx [2] in terms of supported number of participants, exchange's throughput and multicast latency. Onyx's techniques can be applied to other existing systems (e.g., DBO) to enhance their performance.},

abstract = {Nine years have passed since the American Registry for Internet Numbers exhausted its allocation of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, and four years have passed since the United States Government mandated federal agencies to complete the transition to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). Despite the IPv4 address shortage and IPv6 mandate, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) are still struggling to sunset IPv4. As demonstrated on SC23's SC23v6 wireless network, newer tooling such as RFC8925 allows clients to disable their IPv4 protocol stack while retaining legacy IP connectivity via the RFC6145 translation algorithm. However, SC23v6 wireless clients without RFC8925 support or a disabled IPv6 stack would continue to receive internet access via legacy IPv4. This paper introduces a method of using poisoned IPv4 Domain Name System (DNS) records to gracefully inform IPv4-only clients at SC24's SC24v6 wireless network about their inability to use the current version of internet protocol, with a goal of minimal impact to RFC8925 and dual-stack clients. When implemented as designed, this method may improve supportability and user experience of IPv6-only deployments at FFRDCs.},

abstract = {Long-range Wide-area Network (LoRaWAN) is an innovative and prominent communication protocol in the domain of Low-power Wide-area Networks (LPWAN), known for its ability to provide long-range communication with low energy consumption. However, the practical implementation of the LoRaWAN protocol, operating at the Medium Access Control layer and specially built to work upon the LoRa physical layer, presents numerous research challenges, including network congestion, interference, optimal resource allocation, collisions, scalability, and security. To mitigate these challenges effectively, the adoption of cutting-edge data-driven technologies such as Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) emerges as a promising approach. Interestingly, very few existing surveys or tutorials have addressed the importance of ML- or DL-based techniques for LoRaWAN. This article provides a comprehensive survey of current LoRaWAN challenges and recent solutions, particularly using DL and ML algorithms. The primary objective of this survey is to stimulate further research efforts to enhance the performance of LoRa networks and facilitate their practical deployments. We begin by emphasizing the characteristics of LoRaWAN compared to other LPWAN technologies and then examine the technical specifications of LoRaWAN that have been released so far, as well as the current research trends. Furthermore, we discuss an overview of the most utilized DL and ML algorithms for overcoming LoRaWAN challenges. We also present an interoperable reference architecture for LoRaWAN and validate its effectiveness using a wide range of applications. Additionally, we shed light on several evolving challenges of LoRa and LoRaWAN for the future digital network, along with possible solutions. Finally, we conclude our discussion by briefly summarizing our work.},

abstract = {LoRa technology has become critical in numerous IoT applications, offering long-range connections with low energy consumption. However, their low-power nature makes them vulnerable to cross-technology interference (CTI) from other wireless technologies sharing the same unlicensed frequency bands. Existing solutions address this issue through signal analysis and coding techniques. Despite these efforts, the research on CTI mitigation needs to go one step further - to design a systematic framework for enhanced interference resilience. This paper proposes SLoRa+, a systematic framework that integrates symbol recovery with soft decoding to achieve synergic interference resilience for LoRa. SLoRa+’s symbol recovery employs a two-stage analysis to recover corrupted LoRa symbols at a low cost. It also estimates the confidence of the recovered symbols by considering the characteristics of both LoRa and CTI. This confidence information is then utilized in soft decoding to improve error correction capabilities. Supported by theoretical analysis and real testbed evaluations, including commercial LoRa nodes and USRP B210, our experiments under different settings, i.e., various CTI sources and frequency bands, demonstrate SLoRa+’s effectiveness. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, SLoRa+ enhances CTI protection capability by 1.6 \texttimes{} with only 1% of the computation cost.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clusters are widely used in spectrum reconnaissance, where spectrum samples are transmitted back to the sink through flying ad hoc network (FANET). High sampling frequencies are required, but result in a large amount of data not being transmitted over the wireless network, affecting throughput and reliability of the network. The problem boils down to what a good sampling frequency is and how to find it. There is an unknown dynamic sampling frequency threshold, beyond which high packet loss occurs. Prior work focused on achieving higher frequencies through FANET optimization but neglected methods to find this threshold and achieve a maximum value. We propose an adaptive protocol based on binary search. With limited bandwidth and consistent sampling frequency, the protocol dynamically adjusts sampling frequencies in a phased manner at the application layer to maximize the sampling frequency that the network can handle. In addition to spectrum reconnaissance, this protocol can be extended to other applications with consistent sampling frequencies. We have constructed an application based on the EXata simulation platform to analyze the performance of the protocol in delay, stability, reliability, and search times. Simulation results show the protocol improves the efficiency and survivability of spectrum reconnaissance.},

Rateless IBLT is based on a novel encoder that incrementally encodes the set difference into an infinite stream of coded symbols, resembling rateless error-correcting codes. We compare Rateless IBLT with state-of-the-art set reconciliation schemes and demonstrate significant improvements. Rateless IBLT achieves 3--4\texttimes{} lower communication cost than non-rateless schemes with similar computation cost, and 2--2000\texttimes{} lower computation cost than schemes with similar communication cost. We show the real-world benefits of Rateless IBLT by applying it to synchronize the state of the Ethereum blockchain, and demonstrate 5.6\texttimes{} lower end-to-end completion time and 4.4\texttimes{} lower communication cost compared to the system used in production.},

abstract = {The provision of performance-aware video conferencing services today relies on approaches that focus on data compression and client-side bitrate adaptation techniques to optimize transmission. However, these methods fail to quickly respond to fluctuations in network conditions, thereby compromising the quality of service for transmissions. For this reason, this paper aims to propose a novel traffic scheduling-based video transmission optimization solution from the perspective of the network service provider.We first investigate the resource requirements of video conferences and present the experiential performance of video conferences under different network conditions and network competition. Based on these results, we design a servicecustomized routing mechanism called VCApather that minimizes network contention. We then provide implementation solutions for the control plane and the data plane of VCApather. We evaluate VCApather using a fully-meshed topology with five nodes and real-world video conference traffic. The results show that VCApather is capable of achieving high link utilization and balance, while also meeting predefined user metrics. Compared to other schemes, VCApather could satisfy 69.8% more QoE requirements and yielded an average bitrate improvement of (times) .},

abstract = {In recent years, a considerable body of literature has shown how Synchronous Flooding (SF)-based communication can provide reliability and latency guarantees in multi-hop networks. However, to-date, the technique has failed to gain traction outside of the research community. While disappointing, this is perhaps not surprising. Many of the key works in SF have focused on improving performance gains or proposing tailored protocols, with little thought to the enduser or wider networking ecosystem. This demo addresses this gap and presents OSFv6, an IPv6-compatible extension to the Open Synchronous Flooding (OSF) framework, that connects SF networks to the wider IP ecosystem and allows users to seamlessly run socket applications between host machines. We benchmark OSFv6 across the four BLE physical layers and show that, using the 2 Mbps physical layer (PHY), OSFv6 can achieve up to 250 kbps at 3 hops. Importantly, we use OSFv6 to transmit a live video stream between two hosts – demonstrating the application for SF networks outside of use-cases envisioned in current literature.},

abstract = {IPv6 is the current version of IP, the protocol that is used to route traffic across internet connections. This standard was originally developed as a new approach to mitigate concerns about address exhaustion and allow for near infinite scalability. While this protocol has gained significant support in mobile and broadband networks, as well as being the default for networks in emerging economies, it has yet to be fully adopted as a standard deployment model. Complications include legacy devices unable to support the proposed changes, as well as potential challenges that exist between devices that may not be able to fully implement current standards or configuration norms.The SCinet volunteers who deliver advanced networking to support the SC Conference set an ambitious goal of deploying an IPv6-only network at SC23. While the necessary technology is widely available and understood, the implications of deployment to support more than 15,000 users, each with multiple devices of different operating environments and ages, presents a unique technology and policy challenge. This paper will highlight the effort put into designing, implementing, and operating this innovative IPv6-only environment.},

abstract = {BGP distributes prefixes advertised by Autonomous Systems (ASes) and computes the best paths between them. It is the only routing protocol used to exchange interdomain routes on the Internet. Since its original definition in the late 1980s, BGP uses TCP. To prevent attacks, BGP has been extended with features such as TCP-MD5, TCP-AO, GTSM and data-plane filters. However, these ad hoc solutions were introduced gradually as the Internet grew. In parallel, TLS was standardized to secure end-to-end data-plane communications. Today, a large proportion of the Internet traffic is secured using TLS. Surprisingly, BGP still does not use TLS despite its adequate security features to establish BGP sessions. In this paper, we make the case for using a secure transport with BGP. This can be achieved with TLS combined with TCP-AO or by replacing TCP by QUIC. This protects the BGP stream using established secure transport protocols. In addition, we show that a secure transport using X.509 certificates enables BGP routers to be securely and automatically configured from these certificates. We extend the open-source BIRD BGP daemon to support TLS with TCP-AO and QUIC, to handle such certificates and demonstrate several use cases that benefit from the secure and automated capabilities enabled by our proposal.},

abstract = {In modern industrial control networks, a large number of system devices use various communication protocols for communication, which puts considerable pressure on device access and production data exchange. Accurate recognition of industrial control protocols is one of the effective ways to solve the above problems. Due to its unique advantages in protocol feature extraction, machine learning based protocol recognition methods have received sustained attention. However, traditional machine learning relies on manually designed feature extractors, which have poor performance in some unknown systems. Therefore, this article proposes an industrial control protocol recognition method based on CNN-EWA-SVM. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to automatically extract effective features of protocols. The Enhanced Whale Algorithm (EWA) optimizes the parameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), further improving the accuracy of protocol recognition. The proposed method was evaluated using actual protocol data, and the experiment proved its superiority.},

abstract = {Machine learning has become ubiquitous across many fields in the last decade and modern real world applications often require a decentralized solution for training such models. This demand sprouted the research in federated learning, which solves some of the challenges with centralized machine learning, but at the same times raises further questions in regard to security, privacy and scalability. We have designed and implemented DecFL, an ubiquitous protocol for decentralized model training. The protocol is machine-learning-model-, vendor-, and technology-agnostic and provides a basis for practitioner's own implementations. The implemented DecFL framework presented in this article is an exemplary realization of the carefully designed protocol stack based on Ethereum and IPFS and offers a scalable baseline solution for decentralized machine learning. In this article, we present a study based on the proposed protocol, its theoretical bounds and experiments based on the implemented framework. Using open-source datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10), we demonstrate key features, the actual cost of training a model (in euro) and the communication overhead. We further show that through a proper choice of technologies DecFL achieves a linear scaling, which is a non-trivial task in a decentralized setting. Along with discussing some of the security challenges in the field, we highlight aggregation poisoning as a relevant attack vector, its associated risks and a possible prevention strategy for decentralized model training through DecFL.},

In response to these problems, this paper proposes a new reward method and an additional reference basis. It aims to enhance the enthusiasm of the node voting by increasing the reward for the node. Combining the attribute values of the nodes in the side chain enables the nodes to have a richer reference basis that can be selected by self-judgment when voting. Experiments show that the extra reward mechanism can bring more rewards to actively participate in voting nodes and increase the enthusiasm of node voting.},

The recently standardized security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) efficiently provides end-to-end security of CoAP messages at the application layer, also in the presence of untrusted intermediaries. At the same time, CoAP supports one-to-many communication, targeting use cases such as smart lighting and building automation, firmware update, or emergency broadcast. Securing group communication for CoAP has additional challenges. It can be done using the novel Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) security protocol, which fulfills the same security requirements of OSCORE in group communication environments. While evaluations of OSCORE are available, no studies exist on the performance of Group OSCORE on resource-constrained IoT devices.This article presents the results of our extensive performance evaluation of Group OSCORE over two popular constrained IoT platforms, namely Zolertia Zoul and TI Simplelink. We have implemented Group OSCORE for the Contiki-NG operating system and made our implementation available as open source software. We compared Group OSCORE against unprotected CoAP as well as OSCORE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive and experimental evaluation of Group OSCORE over real constrained IoT devices.},

abstract = {The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authenticating client devices to WiFi networks, and it is designed to be extensible with new authentication methods. We look at ways to extend the protocol to support credential provisioning and configuration of new client devices. As large numbers of IoT devices are deployed, the task will be simplified by combining the network connectivity, identity and certificate provisioning, and application-layer connectivity to one process. The solution will also allow the use of a one-time credential for the initial authentication, so that the long-term device certificate is issued automatically after the first connection to the network. The paper analyzes the requirements and architectural design options that implement such a user experience. We consider solutions that transfer short bootstrapping data inside the EAP session and then implement the provisioning and configuration with web APIs over HTTPS. This allows future flexibility and speed of development in the provisioning and configuration steps. We designed and implemented several architecturally different solutions and present the comparison results and also compare with previous proposals that have similar goals.},

This work addresses third party mediated systems for digital content where mutually unknown, and hence non-trusting, buyers, sellers and the mediator (third party) take part in an exchange protocol. We address the lack of guaranteed fairness, as defined above, in the existing platforms for this setting. We present TEDX, a decentralized solution for guaranteed three party fair exchange of digital goods with scalability and support for incremental deployment over the existing (non-fair) platforms. TEDX combines carefully crafted message exchanges with incentive schemes designed to deter malicious behavior. TEDX also leverages ideas from blockchain anchored state-channels to provide trusted execution while minimizing the operational overheads of blockchain.We present the design and a security analysis of TEDX to validate the claimed fairness properties. We also present the details of a prototype implementation of TEDX leveraging Hyperledger Fabric and performance evaluation of the same on a realistic testbed spanning five public cloud zones. Our results indicate that TEDX adds only a minimal overhead of 16% while being 46x faster than a naive blockchain solution, thereby demonstrating that TEDX is scalable.},

As packet sizes increase, so does the likelihood of errors, resulting in a higher probability of undetected errors in the packet. This paper presents a Multi-Level Error Detectio n (MLED) framework that leverages in-network resources to reduce undetected error probability (UEP) in file transmission. MLED is based on a configurable recursive architecture that organizes communication in layers at different levels, decoupling network functions such as error detection, routing, addressing, and security. Each layer Lij at level i implements a policy Pij that governs its operation, including the error detection mechanism used, specific to the scope of that layer. MLED can be configured to mimic the error detection mechanisms of existing large-scale file transfer protocols. The recursive structure of MLED is analyzed and it shows that adding additional levels of error detection reduces the overall UEP. An adversarial error model is designed to introduce errors into files that evade detection by multiple error detection policies. Through experimentation using the FABRIC testbed the traditional approach, with transport- and data link- layer error detection, results in a corrupt file transfer requiring retransmission of the entire file. Using its recursive structure, an implementation of MLED detects and corrects these adversarial errors at intermediate levels inside the network, avoiding file retransmission under non-zero error rates. MLED therefore achieves a 100% gain in goodput over the traditional approach, reaching a goodput of over 800 Mbps on a single connection with no appreciable increase in delay.},

Surprisingly, age minimizing rates over fast Internet paths are about 0.5 Mbps, which is a small fraction, for example, of link rates supported by WiFi wireless access technology. We also show that congestion control algorithms employed by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), including hybrid approaches that achieve higher throughputs at lower delays than traditional loss-based congestion control, are unsuitable for age control.},

Even though the specifications are not completely finished, several important entities have started to adopt the FAPI 2.0 protocols, including Norway’s national HelseID, Australia’s Consumer Data Standards, as well as private companies like Authlete and Australia-based connectID; the predecessor FAPI 1.0 is in widespread use with millions of users. The FAPI WG asked us to accompany the standardization of the FAPI 2.0 protocols with a formal security analysis to proactively identify vulnerabilities before widespread deployment and to provide formal security guarantees for the standards. In this paper, we report on our analysis and findings. Our analysis is based on a detailed model of the Web infrastructure, the so-called Web Infrastructure Model (WIM), which we extend to be able to carry out our analysis of the FAPI 2.0 protocols including important extensions like FAPI-CIBA. Based on the (extended) WIM and formalizations of the security goals and attacker model laid out in the FAPI 2.0 specifications, we provide a formal model of the protocols and carry out a formal security analysis, revealing several attacks. We have worked with the FAPI WG to fix the protocols, resulting in several amendments to the specifications. With these changes in place, we have adjusted our protocol model and formally proved that the security properties hold true under the strong attacker model defined by the FAPI WG.},

However, TCP’s inherent inefficiencies fail to effectively handle the inevitable instabilities of large-scale cloud networks, resulting in long tail latency. As a major cloud vendor, we’ve received numerous customer reports of long tail latency significantly degrading application performance. Despite extensive efforts, existing solutions face various deployment issues that limit their adoption in cloud networks. To this end, we propose Bifrost, a reliable transport protocol specifically optimized for TCP performance in cloud networks. Bifrost leverages techniques including RTT-aware multipath transmission, hybrid hardware-software packet reordering, optimized ACK mechanisms, and rapid loss detection. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Bifrost achieves an average 18.8x reduction in P99 latency compared to native TCP in various packet loss scenarios.},

abstract = {The last three decades have seen much evolution in web and network protocols: amongst them, a transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 and a shift from loss-based to delay-based TCP congestion control algorithms. This paper argues that these two trends come at odds with one another, ultimately hurting web performance. Using a controlled synthetic study, we show how delay-based congestion control protocols (e.g., BBR and CUBIC + Hybrid Slow Start) result in the underestimation of the available congestion window in mobile networks, and how that dramatically hampers the effectiveness of HTTP/2. To quantify the impact of such finding in the current web, we evolve the web performance toolbox in two ways. First, we develop Igor, a client-side TCP congestion control detection tool that can differentiate between loss-based and delay-based algorithms by focusing on their behavior during slow start. Second, we develop a Chromium patch which allows fine-grained control on the HTTP version to be used per domain. Using these new web performance tools, we analyze over 300 real websites and find that 67% of sites relying solely on delay-based congestion control algorithms have better performance with HTTP/1.1.},

Optimizing the backoff mechanism of MAC layer in the network can effectively improve the network performance. Based on MAC single-layer model, the effect of acoustic channel on packet transmission is rarely considered. In this paper, a scheme of cross-layer information interaction between the physical layer and MAC layer is adopted. According to the results of synchronous detection of the physical layer, the causes of packet failure are classified as packet collision and acoustic channel effect, and the size of contention window is adjusted accurately. MAC layer reasonably adjusts the transmission power of physical layer according to the current network communication state. The underwater environment is simulated using the UAN module in the NS-3 simulation platform, and the traditional backoff algorithm is compared with the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed backoff mechanism based on cross-layer information interaction is better than the traditional backoff mechanism.},

Most of the network transports today still make the long-held assumption about application traffic, i.e., a byte stream with an unlimited data arrival rate. In this paper, we demonstrate, through both analyses and experiments, that the emerging traffic dynamics and message-level data structure have huge impacts on the correctness and effectiveness of CC, but none of the existing solutions treats these two characteristics appropriately. Therefore, we present Amphis, a new CC framework that re-architects the current pure network-oriented design into a dual-control architecture, which combines application-coordinated control and network-oriented control. Amphis contains two novel ideas, i.e., pattern-driven proactive probing for handling traffic dynamics and message-driven adaptive optimization for optimizing message transmission performance. Our preliminary results show that Amphis holds great promise in terms of accurate bandwidth estimation under dynamic traffic conditions and effective data transfer at message granularity.},

In this demonstration, we show that enabling Radio Link Control (RLC) layer retransmissions can significantly increase throughput without additional processing complexity. Using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G-NTN suite, we showcase the effectiveness of RLC Acknowledged Mode (AM) retransmissions in facilitating early recovery of lost packets and maintaining reasonable Quality of Service (QoS), even in the absence of HARQ feedback from the MAC layer.},

abstract = {Data transmission tends to be neglected when considering the carbon efficiency of systems, even though the electricity usage of data networks as a whole is as large, or larger, than that of data centers. Accounting for carbon cost of the movement of data is hard, and is often assumed to be the responsibility of the receiver or an intermediate provider.To be able to account for the carbon footprint of networks, mutually agreed metrics are required, covering the end-to-end environmental cost of data transmission and up-the-stack network software costs of data processing, rather than merely the independent network devices.Beyond discussing the considerations for defining these metrics, this paper suggests building upon existing practices, such as network telemetry, programmable network elements and cost-aware routing to enable carbon-intelligent networking, a concept that goes beyond network energy efficiency and considers the impact of energy decarbonization on the routing and scheduling of data transmission.},

abstract = {In many low-power wireless systems, a condition occurring at some nodes (e.g., an anomalous sensor sample, an aperiodic packet to transmit, a new joining node) determines whether the entire network should be awake (e.g., to react to the anomaly, deliver the packet, update the node group) or enter sleep. State-of-the-art protocols exploit periodic network-wide floods based on concurrent transmissions (e.g., via Glossy) to establish the global decision quickly, reliably, and efficiently. Still, time is of the essence: the faster the network agrees, the faster it either reacts or enters sleep. Flick achieves this global decision with order-of-magnitude latency improvements and 5-nines reliability by detecting and disseminating a binary on/off vote via the preamble of a packet instead of its full content. The actual realization of this simple idea entails several techniques on the ultra-wideband (UWB) radios we use. We evaluate Flick over a 78-node network in the Cloves testbed showing that, e.g., a single node can globally flick the switch to on across a 10-hop diameter in &lt; 500&amp;#U+03BC;s&nbsp;, i.e., roughly the time for a Glossy packet to go across a single hop, and with 4.4 \texttimes{} less energy. We demonstrate the potential of Flick by integrating it into staple protocols and evaluating the performance improvements it enables.},

abstract = {Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) promise revolutionary clinical and research applications. State-of-the-art iBCIs rely on high-density (HD) microelectrode arrays (MEAs) to sense massive neuronal populations. However, HD MEAs are bandwidth-demanding, posing a significant challenge for wireless iBCIs. Prior iBCI systems have relied on compression to reduce neural signal bitrate. Unfortunately, existing schemes are blind to neurons' signal characteristics, resulting in poor compression efficiency and severe degradation in iBCI performance.This paper explores a neuron-aware approach to the design of efficient brain-to-computer communication systems. We present NeuroZip, a neural signal compression scheme that significantly reduces bitrate without compromising neural features, enabling various wireless iBCI applications to track neurons under limited bandwidth. To achieve this, NeuroZip first models and analyzes the complex feature space of HD neural signals, and then embraces neuron-awareness into an efficient genetic search algorithm that can quickly converge to an optimal compression strategy despite the large solution space yielded by HD MEA's high microelectrode count. Preliminary experiments conducted on real neural datasets show that, compared to neuron-blind schemes, NeuroZip reduces bandwidth by up to 2.2x under the same error constraint, or reduces error rate by up to 8x under the same bandwidth. Further experiments demonstrate NeuroZip imposes minimal impacts on downstream iBCI tasks, limiting the increase of error rate within 2.4% for three representative iBCI applications.},

We show that (i) each Sync protocol can be characterized by its design decisions on three basic components - dataset namespace representation, namespace encoding for sharing, and change notification mechanism, and (ii) two or three types of choices have been observed for each design component. Through analysis and experimental evaluation, we reveal how different design choices influence the latency, reliability, overhead, and security of dataset synchronization. We also discuss the relationship between transport and application naming, the implications of namespace encoding for Sync group scalability, and the fundamental reason behind the need for Sync Interest multicast.},

Firstly, group the system nodes, select the main nodes of each group and each group of high reputation nodes to form a consensus cluster, and perform hierarchical consensus within and between groups. Secondly, the consensus process is optimized. The main nodes of each group use an improved two-stage PBFT algorithm for inter group consensus, and the ELGamal type threshold signature consensus scheme is used in the intra group consensus. Finally, improvements were made to the view switching protocol to reduce communication overhead during view switching. The experimental results show that compared to the PBFT algorithm, the TGBFT algorithm has lower communication complexity, better performance in consensus latency and throughput than the PBFT algorithm, and has good consensus efficiency and scalability.},

abstract = {Fully Encrypted Protocols (FEPs) have arisen in practice as a technique to avoid network censorship. Such protocols are designed to produce messages that appear completely random. This design hides communications metadata, such as version and length fields, and makes it difficult to even determine what protocol is being used. Moreover, these protocols frequently support padding to hide the length of protocol fields and the contained message. These techniques have relevance well beyond censorship circumvention, as protecting protocol metadata has security and privacy benefits for all Internet communications. The security of FEP designs depends on cryptographic assumptions, but neither security definitions nor proofs exist for them. We provide novel security definitions that capture the metadata-protection goals of FEPs. Our definitions are given in both the datastream and datagram settings, which model the ubiquitous TCP and UDP interfaces available to protocol designers. We prove relations among these new notions and existing security definitions. We further present new FEP constructions and prove their security. Finally, we survey existing FEP candidates and characterize the extent to which they satisfy FEP security. We identify novel ways in which these protocols are identifiable, including their responses to the introduction of data errors and the sizes of their smallest protocol messages.},

abstract = {Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) promise to sense brain activity at an unprecedented scale and resolution. However, unlocking this potential for practical, untethered applications remains an unsolved challenge. The major barrier is the significant wireless bandwidth required to stream high-resolution brain signals. Existing approaches rely on extensive on-device processing, which is severely constrained by the limited resources of iBCI devices, the complexity of brain signals, and the dynamic nature of neural activity. This paper introduces Neuralite, a wireless iBCI system that integrates high-fidelity brain signal models and effective brain sensing mechanisms within an efficient server-driven streaming framework. By thoroughly characterizing brain signal variability, Neuralite adaptively optimizes streaming under dynamic neural conditions, minimizing bandwidth consumption without imposing excessive burdens on resource-constrained iBCI devices. Experimental results demonstrate that Neuralite significantly reduces bandwidth consumption while preserving neural decoding precision across key iBCI components and representative applications.},

In such networks, broadcast is known to be an inefficient operation in terms of message complexity and overhead. In addition to the impact on the system performance, inefficient or delayed block propagation may have severe consequences regarding security and fairness of the consensus layer. In contrast, the Kadcast protocol is a structured peer-to-peer protocol for block and transaction propagation in blockchain networks. Kadcast utilizes the well-known overlay topology of Kademlia to realize an efficient broadcast operation with tunable overhead. We study the security and privacy of the Kadcast protocol based on probabilistic models and analyze its resilience to packet losses and node failures. Moreover, we evaluate Kadcast’s block delivery performance, broadcast reliability, efficiency, and security based on advanced network simulations. Lastly, we introduce a QUIC-based prototype implementation of the Kadcast protocol and show its merits through deployment in a global-scale cloud-based testbed.},

abstract = {Traffic signal priority and preemption modify the traffic signals, offering priority to specific vehicle types, such as buses, streetcars, or emergency vehicles. Specialized hardware and software systems are developed to facilitate the preemption and prioritization signal application (PPSA). Nevertheless, the international standards and the existing research works focus on providing a solid foundation for the application, rather than deploying them in high-density road networks, where the distances between two consecutive intersections are shorter than typical roads and are commonly seen in Southeast Asia cities. The shorter distances between intersections result in less time for the vehicle drivers to react when the PPSA does not grant their request, raising safety concerns. This work proposes a software framework for the PPSA, including a detailed analysis of the international standards related to PPSA, a timely response mechanism (to provide a longer reaction time after thoroughly analyzing the standards for exchanging messages), and a time estimation model (to evaluate if the system configurations have safety concerns). Experiments are conducted on our prototype system with actual hardware platforms. The experimental results show the proposed framework works well for high-density road networks. The time estimation model can be used to assess the traffic safety of PPSA systems under different system configurations. The proposed framework, standard protocol analysis, and time estimation model can be used by system designers to improve the safety and efficiency of PPSA systems, especially in areas with small street blocks.},

However, the traditional AKA protocol does not allow the micro operator to authenticate mobile users independently. To solve this problem, we propose the Fast AKA protocol, which disseminates a subscriber’s profile among base stations via a Blockchain and mutually authenticates the subscriber and serving base station locally for roaming. The proposed architecture speeds up the authentication process, provides forward/backward secrecy, and resists replay attack as well as man-in-the-middle attack.

In this research, we show that recent emerging technologies from the analog domain have a high potential in supporting network functions with energy efficiency and more expressiveness, so called cognitive functions. We propose an analog packet processing architecture building on a novel technology named Memristors. We develop a novel analog match-action memory called Probabilistic Content-Addressable Memory (pCAM) for supporting deterministic and probabilistic match functions. We develop the programming abstractions and show the support of pCAM for an active queue management-based analog network function. The analysis over an experimental dataset of a memristor chip showed only 0.01 fJ/bit/cell of energy consumption for corresponding analog computations which is 50 times less than digital computations.},

abstract = {The underwater acoustic communication medium introduces significant challenges that often limit communication to flooding protocols. This work presents the Network Allocation Technique in Flooding (NATFLOOD) protocol, intended for use with Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs). NATFLOOD applies a novel Adaptive Network Allocation Vector (ANAV) to reduce duplicates and collisions. The performance of NATFLOOD is tested in a comparative simulation against DFLOOD, a leading UASN flooding protocol. In simulation, NATFLOOD demonstrates an average reduction in duplicates and collisions of 24.29 ± 0.01% when compared to DFLOOD. This reduction is achieved by the ability of NATFLOOD to solve the broadcast problem with 19.96 ± 0.03% fewer packets than DFLOOD. This reduction is achieved with an increase to protocol completion time of 2.21 ± 0.02%.},

abstract = {DoIP, which is defined in ISO&nbsp;13400, is a transport protocol stack for diagnostic data. Diagnostic data is a potential attack vector at vehicles, so secure transmission must be guaranteed to protect sensitive data and the vehicle. Previous work analyzed a draft version and earlier versions of the DoIP protocol without tls. No formal analysis exists for the DoIP protocol. The goal of this work is to investigate the DoIP protocol for design flaws that may lead to security vulnerabilities and possible attacks to exploit them. For this purpose, we deductively analyze the DoIP protocol in a first step and subsequently confirm our conclusions formally. For the formal analysis, we use the prover Tamarin. Based on the results, we propose countermeasures to improve the DoIP’s security. We show that the DoIP protocol cannot be considered secure mainly because the security mechanisms tls and client authentication in the DoIP protocol are not mandatory. We propose measures to mitigate the vulnerabilities that we confirm to remain after activating tls. These require only a minor redesign of the protocol.},

abstract = {With the rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing diversity of network applications, traditional network architectures have often struggled to meet the high demands for performance, reliability, and flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a network architecture that leverages an improved MPLS protocol in combination with SDN technology. The integration of MPLS protocol, a widely used routing protocol, enables fast and efficient traffic forwarding. MPLS labels are attached to packets, allowing them to be quickly forwarded through the network without the need for complex routing calculations. This ensures high-quality service delivery and reduces latency, crucial for real-time applications such as voice and video conferencing. SDN technology, on the other hand, enables centralized control and flexible network management. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, allowing network administrators to programmatically control network behavior. This provides greater operational efficiency as changes can be made quickly and easily without having to manually configure individual devices. SDN also enables scalability as new devices can be easily integrated into the network without disrupting existing operations. By effectively combining MPLS protocol and SDN technology, we can create a high-performance, highly reliable, and flexible network architecture that meets the modern networking requirements. This architecture not only enhances network efficiency but also reduces operational costs, making it an attractive solution for tomorrow's networking needs.},

At present, real-time personal status monitoring systems are receiving sufficient attention in personalized medical services. In this article, a smart mattress real-time monitoring system design based on ISO/IEEE 11073 standard is proposed. The smart mattress detects and monitors important parameters of the human body and is aware of the body posture and whether the person is leaving the bed or not. This smart mattress-based real-time monitoring system can perform effective and accurate measurements at night without medical personnel. However, this promising device has not been standardized yet. This paper provides the system design and 11073 protocol implementation ideas for the smart mattress, which mainly include domain information model, service model and communication model.},

abstract = {As the data center networks' bandwidth-delay product is increasing and the applications are moving to nano services (with many small flows), managing flows in the network is becoming more challenging. Current TCP/IP stack faces fundamental limitations to meet these challenges. First, it lacks the ability to accurately estimate the network state under dynamic network settings. Second, the current stack is not flexible enough to be extended easily. In this work, we propose a framework, Augmenter, that augments (i.e., increases the network visibility of) the TCP/IP stack to address these challenges. Leveraging eBPF, Augmenter gathers the state of ongoing flows and uses this information to manage other flows that are currently active or arriving in the future. We present one specific use case of setting the initial congestion window of flows dynamically based on network conditions. Our initial tests, show that Augmenter can improve the application performance by up to 1.4x compared to the fixed initial window-based solutions. Implementing Augmenter in the TCP/IP stack itself is not trivial. Augmenter employs eBPF to implement its desired functionality as it enables introducing such changes relatively easy. We discuss potential challenges and solutions in designing and implementing Augmenter applications.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that continues to stir the curiosity of the scientific community, which has been the subject of several research studies in recent years. Formed by a very large number of connected devices, IoT applications generate a huge amount of data to be processed and analyzed taking into account the constraints of latency and energy. Fog computing has proven to be an efficient way to provide computing, management and storage resources through small distributed data centers located at the edge of the network, as close as possible to end-users and connected devices, offering accordingly reduced latency and energy saving. In this context, energy efficiency is one of the parameters that must be emphasized in order to cope with the increased consumption of energy associated with this gigantic volume of data. The proposed work presents a new approach based on a Fog-IoT architecture with the objective of ensuring smart energy management during communication and processing of offloaded tasks in IoT applications while respecting the latency constraint. Experimental results attests the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of energy efficiency.},

Existing CVP systems employ either a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) view exchange paradigm. In this paper, we advocate a hybrid CVP design: our developed system, Harbor, employs V2I as its fundamental underlying framework, and opportunistically employs V2V to boost the performance. In Harbor, vehicles (helpers) may serve as relays to assist other vehicles (helpees) in reaching an edge node, which performs sensor data merging to produce the extended view. We judiciously partition the workload between the edge and vehicles, develop a robust helper-helpee assignment model, and solve it efficiently at runtime. We conduct both real-world tests and large-scale emulation experiments using two prevailing CAV applications: drivable space detection and object detection. Our real-world evaluation conducted at one of the world's first purpose-built autonomous driving testbeds demonstrates that Harbor outperforms state-of-the-art V2V- or V2I-only CVP schemes by up to 36% in detection accuracy, resulting in significantly fewer collisions under dangerous driving scenarios.},

Three areas are proposed as areas to be studied and developed. First, bringing the application compiler/runtime environment and the distribution orchestrator closer together such that they can share information of namespaces and mapping to lower level addressing. This would allow greater flexibility in application development and much greater optimisation of the distribution at runtime. Second, developing semantic routing as a layered framework based on information understood within a layer and information transparent to a layer. This allows semantic routing to be introduced in an evolutionary fashion. Third, embracing private networking as a primary construct of future Internet routing and addressing. This meets many practical requirements including security. The second and third also give a framework where the current widespread use of L4 and L7 switching in microservices frameworks can be clearly understood and the role they play fully incorporated for in future Internet routing and addressing.},

The next generation of intelligent vehicular networks enabled by 5G systems will integrate various heterogeneous wireless techniques to enable time-sensitive services with guaranteed quality of service and ultimate bandwidth usage. However, to allow the dense diversity of wireless technologies, seamless and reliable wireless communication protocols need to be thoroughly investigated in vehicular networks environment. Henceforth, efficient mobility management protocols that mitigate the challenges of vehicles’ mobility is essential to support massive data loads throughout various applications. In this article, we review different mobility management protocols and their ability to address issues related to 5G-enabled vehicular networks within the related works. First, we provide a broad view of existing models of vehicular networks and their applicability to the next generation of wireless networks. Next, we propose a classification of several vehicular network models that suit the 5G wireless network, followed by a thorough discussion of the mobility management challenges in each of these network models that need to be addressed and then discuss each of their benefits and drawbacks accordingly.},

abstract = {Automotive Ethernet is considered to be the next-generation in-vehicle network, because of its high bandwidth, high throughput, and low cost characteristics. However, no common standard has been established for the security protocol of Automotive Ethernet. While there are a few candidates, including MACsec, IPsec, and TLS, there is no widely favored candidate. Most importantly, existing candidates cannot fully satisfy the requirements of in-vehicle communication, specifically source authentication for broadcast/multicast communication. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis in both security and performance of existing security protocol candidates and identify source authentication and Denial-of-Service (DoS) prevention as two essential but missing properties in these candidates. We propose Gatekeeper, a gateway-based broadcast authentication protocol to ensure source authentication. In general, Gatekeeper introduces an on-path authenticator, which co-locates with the in-vehicle gateway or domain controllers and helps receivers to verify the sender's identity. To defend against DoS threats, we further integrate the time-lock puzzle with Gatekeeper to slow down malicious traffic. Our performance evaluation results show that Gatekeeper only results in 0.03 ms latency overhead for CAN data transmission and outperforms TESLA on both CAN and LiDAR transmission scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of Gatekeeper.},

Our solution overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional IEEE 802.11 series protocols, which cannot simultaneously communicate with the same-frequency same-time full-duplex. Based on the OMNeT++ open source network simulation platform, we develop an asynchronous Ad-Hoc full-duplex network simulator.

abstract = {Underlying blockchain's scalability and performance is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay network and protocols for relaying blocks and transactions among participating nodes. In this work, we model and perform a systematic analysis of blockchain communication protocols. We begin by introducing the performance metric of interest for blockchains, the sequence of ordered-completion-times, which captures the progress distributed nodes are making in jointly constructing a consistent blockchain. We then study the characteristics of block relaying protocols. In particular, we show that when nodes cannot perform cut-through relaying, there is no optimal causal block relaying protocol if block relaying times are deterministic. We propose a simple age-based block relaying protocol that is provably near-optimal in terms of minimizing ordered-completion-times when the P2P overlay network is a tree. This analysis is relevant to blockchain relay networks such as Bitcoin-Fibre, Bloxroute etc., where the core part of the overlay is a tree. Finally, using the insights derived for tree overlays, we explore the interplay between transaction and block relaying and prioritization (age, size, FCFS based) on both tree and fully connected overlays via simulation. We observe that policies that relay blocks and incorporate transactions into blocks based on 'age' outperform other natural policies. We also explore a fundamental tradeoff between mining and computational efficiencies and performance (in terms of ordered completion times).},

abstract = {Low-power wireless networks have the potential to enable applications that are of great importance to industry and society. However, existing network protocols do not meet the dependability requirements of many scenarios as the failure of a single node or link can completely disrupt communication and take significant time and energy to recover. This paper presents Hydra, a low-power wireless protocol that guarantees robust communication despite arbitrary node and link failures. Unlike most existing deterministic protocols, Hydra steers clear of centralized coordination to avoid a single point of failure. Instead, all nodes are equivalent in terms of protocol logic and configuration, performing coordination tasks such as synchronization and scheduling concurrently. This concept of concurrent coordination relies on a novel distributed consensus algorithm that yields provably unique decisions with low delay and energy overhead. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we evaluate Hydra in a multi-hop network of 23 nodes. Our experiments demonstrate that Hydra withstands random node failures without increasing coordination overhead and that it re-establishes efficient and reliable data exchange within seconds after a major disruption.},

In this paper, we explore how information-centric networking can ease reliable firmware updates. We start from the recent standards developed by the IETF SUIT working group and contribute a system that allows for a timely discovery of new firmware versions by using cryptographically protected manifest files. Our design enables a cascading firmware roll-out from a gateway towards leaf nodes in a low-power multi-hop network. While a chunking mechanism prepares firmware images for typically low-sized maximum transmission units (MTUs), an early Denial-of-Service (DoS) detection prevents the distribution of tampered or malformed chunks. In experimental evaluations on a real-world IoT testbed, we demonstrate feasible strategies with adaptive bandwidth consumption and a high resilience to connectivity loss when replicating firmware images into the IoT edge.},

EuroP4 is the official European Workshop of the P4 language consortium, aiming to bring together network researchers and practitioners from Europe and from around the world, to discuss research ideas and opportunities for innovation in networks enabled by the P4 language ecosystem.Since its introduction in 2014, the P4 language has played a central role into the important ongoing march towards the next era of network programmability. A language like P4 together with compatible targets allows the developers to program all aspects of network behavior, all the way to the data plane, giving them unprecedented flexibility, control, and visibility, and unleashing innovation at previously unimaginable scale. Initially focused on high-speed packet processing pipelines of routers and switches, the language has proven to be fully applicable to a variety of different platforms (high-throughput switches, IPUs/DPUs, smartNICs and end-host network stacks) on an end-to-end network path. The scope of the P4 ecosystem has broadened as well, continuously welcoming new applications, protocols and tools. Paraphrasing an older blog post on P4 by Bruce Davie, the founder of Systems Approach LLC, today "P4 is much more than a domainspecific programming language, it is really about the future of programmable network infrastructure".},

abstract = {Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are fundamental to reaching the concept of smart cities. However, the incoming development of vehicular applications will originate an increase in long-term evolution (LTE) traffic demand, so an approach consists of reducing the cell coverage area. This paper presents an alternative solution to deal with areas with a lack of coverage originated by the deployment of LTE micro-cells. We propose a heterogeneous network algorithm named Multi-Metric Heterogeneous Network Algorithm (MMHNA), which uses LTE and dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technologies. The objective is to extend the LTE communication range with the support of DSRC technology through a forwarding process. This proposal will allow vehicles to send messages to a server directly connected to the evolved Node B (eNB), i.e., the radio network node for LTE networks, even if the sending vehicle is out of range of the eNB.},

abstract = {Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks remain a severe and constant threat to the Internet. While various mitigation strategies have been developed and deployed to defend against these attacks, the community lacks adequate metrics for quantifying their efficacy. Metrics used to quantify DoS attacks provide a solid starting point, but extending them to the domain of mitigations is non-trivial. Current metrics don’t account for a mitigation’s overhead outside periods of attack, and fail to capture important context – differences in attack rate, client behavior, network topology, and various other factors can all dramatically alter the impact of attacks and the efficacy of mitigations. This paper provides a methodology and novel suite of metrics designed to enable more meaningful and contextual measurement of DoS mitigations. To illustrate the benefits of these metrics we conduct experiments in the DeterLab network testbed measuring the efficacy of SYN Cookies, a well-known and widely used mitigation against the ubiquitous TCP SYN flood attack. We show that this mitigation is highly effective in certain contexts but can significantly degrade client quality of service in others. Our goal is to help device owners and network operators determine which mitigations are best suited for their particular context, and to help protocol designers and implementers develop a more DoS-resilient Internet.},

abstract = {Today, wireless networks are operating in increasingly complex environments, impacting the evaluation and validation of new networking solutions. Simulation, although fully controllable and easily reproducible, depends on simplified physical layer and channel models, which often produce optimistic results. Experimentation is also influenced by external random phenomena and limited testbed scale and availability, resulting in hardly repeatable and reproducible results. Previously, we have proposed the Trace-based Simulation (TS) approach to address the problem. TS uses traces of radio link quality and position of nodes to accurately reproduce past experiments in ns-3. Yet, in its current version, TS is not compatible with scenarios where Multiple-In-Multiple-Out (MIMO) is used. This is especially relevant since ns-3 assumes perfectly independent MIMO radio streams.In this paper, we introduce the Trace-based Wi-Fi Station Manager Model, which is capable of reproducing the Rate Adaptation of past Wi-Fi experiments, including the number of effective radio streams used. To validate the proposed model, the network throughput was measured in different experiments performed in the w-iLab.t testbed, considering Single-In-Single-Out (SISO) and MIMO operation using IEEE 802.11a/n/ac standards. The experimental results were then compared with the network throughput achieved using the improved TS and Pure Simulation (PS) approaches, validating the new proposed model and confirming its relevance to reproduce experiments previously executed in real environments.},

The real testing of proposed algorithms and models are expensive and time consuming. In this scenario, simulation tools play a vital role to measure the effectiveness and correctness of any new models or schemes. On the other hand, the Internet of things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies around the world. IoT is a technological ecosystem where devices are connected to each other and can exchange information without any human intervention. An IoT system generally suffers from two major problems: device resource restriction and protocol design. To handle these problems, a robust and resilient medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial for numerous machine-type devices to concurrently access the channel in IoT. A MAC protocol affects not only system performance but also energy efficiency. In this paper, various performance evaluation tools, which are used for evaluating MAC protocols for IoT, are discussed and compared with each other in terms of major features, characteristics, pros, and cons.},

abstract = {We present PC-RPL, a transmission power-controlled IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy wireless networks that significantly improves the end-to-end packet delivery performance under heavy traffic compared to the standard RPL. We show through actual design, implementation, and experiments that a multihop wireless network can achieve better throughput and routing stability when transmission power and routing topology are “jointly and adaptively” controlled. Our experiments show that the predominant “fixed and uniform” transmission power strategy with “link quality and hop distance”–based routing topology construction (i.e., RPL) loses significant bandwidth due to hidden terminal and load imbalance problems. We design an adaptive and distributed control mechanism for transmission power and routing topology, named PC-RPL, on top of the standard RPL routing protocol for hidden terminal mitigation and load balancing. We implement PC-RPL on real embedded devices and evaluate its performance on a 49-node multihop testbed. PC-RPL reduces total end-to-end packet losses by approximately sevenfold without increasing hop distance compared to RPL with the highest transmission power, resulting in 17% improvement in aggregate bandwidth and 64% improvement for the worst-case node by successfully alleviating both hidden terminal and load imbalance problems.},

abstract = {Named-Data Transport (NDT) is introduced to provide efficient content delivery by name over the existing IP Internet. NDT consists of the integration of three end-to-end architectural components: The first connection-free reliable transport protocol, the Named-Data Transport Protocol (NDTP); minor extensions to the Domain Name System (DNS) to include records containing manifests describing content; and transparent caches that track pending requests for content. NDT uses receiver-driven requests (Interests) to request content and NDT proxies that provide transparent caching of content while enforcing privacy. The performance of NDT, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Named-Data Networking (NDN) is compared using off-the-shelf implementations in the ns-3 simulator. The results demonstrate that NDT outperforms TCP and is as efficient as NDN, but without making any changes to the existing Internet routing infrastructure.},

In this paper we perform the first measurement study of a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) network in the bulk power grid.

However, 4G/5G mobility management is not always reliable in extreme mobility, with non-negligible failures and policy conflicts. The root cause is that, existing mobility management is primarily based on wireless signal strength. While reasonable in static and low mobility, it is vulnerable to dramatic wireless dynamics from extreme mobility in triggering, decision, and execution. We devise REM, Reliable Extreme Mobility management for 4G, 5G, and beyond. REM shifts to movement-based mobility management in the delay-Doppler domain. Its signaling overlay relaxes feedback via cross-band estimation, simplifies policies with provable conflict freedom, and stabilizes signaling via scheduling-based OTFS modulation. Our evaluation with operational high-speed rail datasets shows that, REM reduces failures comparable to static and low mobility, with low signaling and latency cost.},

abstract = {Robust connectivity and sufficient bandwidth are not natural in most wireless network architectures. The increase of data rates that is mostly caused by multimedia traffic relying on QoS requirements complicates almost lossless delivery. Especially MANETs communications face these challenges, as nodes are moving at runtime. It is well known, that these network architectures have difficulties delivering time-critical data, since no central instance is in place. Bandwidth-demanding multimedia traffic easily causes stressed and overloaded network segments which result in bottlenecks and dropped packets. Introducing a SDN controller is a logical consequence to distribute traffic on nodes based on the knowledge of the entire topology. QoS requirements of all flows can be considered by the controller during routing. However, this brings up the question of how to keep the controller's topology up to date regarding lost and newly arisen connections since nodes are moving continuously. An outdated view of the topology results in deployed routes where no continuous connection between the nodes remains active. We therefore introduce CeTUP, a controller-equipped topology update process designed to provide an overview of the network as accurate as possible, before routing takes place by the controller. We show that this update process achieves QoS conform delivery rates even when nodes are moving at a speed of up to 60~km/h.},

abstract = {The information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm offers replication of autonomously verifiable content throughout a network, in which content is bound to names instead of hosts. This has proven beneficial in particular for the constrained IoT. Several approaches, the most prominent of which being Named Data Networking, propose access to named content directly on the network layer. Independently, the IETF CoAP protocol group started to develop mechanisms that support autonomous content processing and in-network storage.In this paper, we explore the emerging CoAP protocol building blocks and how they contribute to an information-centric network architecture for a data-oriented RESTful Web of Things. We discuss design options and measure characteristic performances of different network configurations, which deploy CoAP proxies and OSCORE content object security, and compare with NDN. Our findings indicate an almost continuous design space ranging from plain CoAP at the one end to NDN on the other. On both ends---ICN and CoAP---we identify protocol features and aspects whose mutual transfer potentially improves design and operation of the other.},

This traffic growth is expected to continue. Generalized deduplication (GD) is a novel technique to effectively compress the data to (a) reduce the data storage cost by identifying similar data chunks, and (b) reduce the pressure on the network infrastructure. This paper presents Hermes, an application-level protocol for the data-plane that can operate using GD as well as classic deduplication. Hermes significantly reduces the data transmission traffic while effectively decreasing the energy footprint, a key goal in many IoT deployments. We fully implemented Hermes, evaluated its performance using consumer-grade IoT devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4B), and highlighted key tradeoffs to be considered to manage real-world workloads. Several fold to several order of magnitude gains over standard compressors and deduplication are achievable.},

abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is today's most popular low-power radio technology with compelling radio performance and battery-friendly characteristics, making it a promising deployment option for the Internet of Things (IoT). Little is known, however, about the performance and pitfalls when utilizing BLE as link layer in multi-hop IP over BLE scenarios, because of the lack of available software platforms and deployment experiences. In this work, we present both a fully open-source, configurable software platform and experiments to analyze multi-hop BLE network behavior. Our experiments, conducted in a larger testbed, reveal unexpected performance drawbacks. Even in scenarios with underutilized links, BLE connections break randomly. This results into large transmission delays on the network layer and thus hinders real-world deployments in the constrained IoT. As key reason for this behavior we identify the BLE connection interval. A deterministic interval leads to unpredictable link behavior and connection losses due to overlapping connection events. We propose randomizing connection intervals as mitigation strategy and demonstrate that this prevents connection losses and sporadic link degradation, improving the overall network behavior.},

abstract = {Task offloading has become a key term in the field of immersive media technologies: it can enable lighter and cheaper devices while providing them higher remote computational capabilities. In this paper we present our TCP-based offloading architecture. The architecture, has been specifically designed for immersive media offloading tasks with a particular care in reducing any processing overhead which can degrade the network performance. We tested the architecture for different offloading scenarios and conditions on two different wireless networks: WiFi and 5G millimeter wave technologies. Besides, to test the network on alternative millimeter wave configurations, currently not available on the actual 5G millimeter rollouts, we used a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) real-time emulator. This emulator was also used to test the offloading architecture for an simulated immersive user sharing network resources with other users. We provide insights of the importance of user prioritization techniques for successful immersive media offloading. The results show a great performance for the tested immersive media scenarios, highlighting the relevance of millimeter wave technology for the future of immersive media applications.},

abstract = {The popularization of video streaming brings challenges in satisfying diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The multipath extension of the Quick UDP Internet Connection (QUIC) protocol, also called MPQUIC, has the potential to improve video streaming performance with multiple simultaneously transmitting paths. The multipath scheduler of MPQUIC determines how to distribute the packets onto different paths. However, while applying current multipath schedulers into MPQUIC, our experimental results show that they fail to adapt to various receive buffer sizes of different devices and comprehensive QoS requirements of video streaming. These problems are especially severe under heterogeneous and dynamic network environments. To tackle these problems, we propose MARS, a Multi-agent deep Reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based Multipath QUIC Scheduler, which is able to promptly adapt to dynamic network environments. It exploits the MADRL method to learn a neural network for each path and generate scheduling policy. Besides, it introduces a novel multi-objective reward function that takes out-of-order queue size and different QoS metrics into consideration to realize adaptive scheduling optimization. We implement MARS in an MPQUIC prototype and deploy in Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP system. Then, we compare it with the state-of-the-art multipath schedulers in both emulated and real-world networks. Experimental results show that MARS outperforms the other schedulers with better adaptive capability regarding the receive buffer sizes and QoS.},

abstract = {Unlicensed LPWANs on ISM bands share the spectrum with various wireless techniques, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee. The explosion of IoT deployments calls for an increasing need for long-range cross-technology communication (CTC) between LPWANs and other techniques. Yet, existing technologies cannot achieve real long-range CTC for commodity wireless. We propose L2X, which provides long-range CTC to diverse receivers with LoRa transmitters. At the heart of L2X, we design an energy-concentrating demodulation mechanism that de-spreads LoRa chirps over the air. Therefore, L2X enables non-LoRa receivers to detect and demodulate LoRa signals even under extremely low SNR. We address practical challenges in L2X design. We propose a packet detection method to detect low-SNR LoRa transmissions at non-LoRa receivers. To decode LoRa transmissions, we accurately synchronize the demodulation window with incoming packets and propose a cross-domain demodulation approach to enhance the demodulation SNR. We implement L2X, all using commodity devices, and extensively evaluate its performance. The results show that L2X achieves 1.2 km CTC with the signal -9 dB below the noise floor, improving the distance by 30X compared with state-of-the-arts.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed growing consolidation of web operations. For example, the majority of web traffic now originates from a few organizations, and even micro-websites often choose to host on large pre-existing cloud infrastructures. In response to this, the "Decentralized Web" attempts to distribute ownership and operation of web services more evenly. This paper describes the design and implementation of the largest and most widely used Decentralized Web platform --- the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) --- an open-source, content-addressable peer-to-peer network that provides distributed data storage and delivery. IPFS has millions of daily content retrievals and already underpins dozens of third-party applications. This paper evaluates the performance of IPFS by introducing a set of measurement methodologies that allow us to uncover the characteristics of peers in the IPFS network. We reveal presence in more than 2700 Autonomous Systems and 152 countries, the majority of which operate outside large central cloud providers like Amazon or Azure. We further evaluate IPFS performance, showing that both publication and retrieval delays are acceptable for a wide range of use cases. Finally, we share our datasets, experiences and lessons learned.},

abstract = {The ongoing digitization of industrial manufacturing leads to a decisive change in industrial communication paradigms. Moving from traditional one-to-one to many-to-many communication, publish/subscribe systems promise a more dynamic and efficient exchange of data. However, the resulting significantly more complex communication relationships render traditional end-to-end security futile for sufficiently protecting the sensitive and safety-critical data transmitted in industrial systems. Most notably, the central message brokers inherent in publish/subscribe systems introduce a designated weak spot for security as they can access all communication messages. To address this issue, we propose ENTRUST, a novel solution for key server-based end-to-end security in publish/subscribe systems. ENTRUST transparently realizes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for publish/subscribe systems without any modification of the underlying protocol. We exemplarily implement ENTRUST on top of MQTT, the de-facto standard for machine-to-machine communication, showing that ENTRUST can integrate seamlessly into existing publish/subscribe systems.},

For example, if a farmer is in the field during a network outage, such as a failure of the mobile network, an alternative communication channel is needed to continue to connect to IT components and required data. With increasing digitalization, Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies are being used more and more frequently, e.g. for sensor networks. The LPWAN technologies offer a high range and can be used autonomously for the most part, but do not allow classic TCP/IP communication. In this work, a popular LPWAN technology, namely LoRaWAN, is experimentally supplemented by AX.25 on OSI layer 2 (Data Link Layer) to allow end devices TCP/IP-based communication over long distances. The evaluation shows that classic low-bandwidth applications are thus functional and can enable reliable, crisis-capable data transmission.},

abstract = {Covert channel, which can break the logical protections of the computer system and leak confidential or sensitive information, has long been considered a security issue in the network research community. However, recent research has shown that cooperative agents can use the "covert" channel to augment the communication of legitimate applications, rather than by adversaries seeking to compromise computer security. This further broadens the potential applications of covert channels. Despite this, the design and implementation of covert channels in the context of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have not been widely discussed. Current state-of-the-art uses On-off keying (OOK) on LoRa PHY to create a covert channel, but this channel has limited transmission distance and capacity. In this paper, we propose LoPhy, a resilient and fast covert channel over LoRa physical layer (PHY). LoPhy uses the Chirp Spreading Spectrum (CSS) modulation scheme to increase its resilience and explore the trade-off between the covert channel’s capacity and the legitimate channel’s resilience. We implement the proposed covert channel on off-the-shelf devices and software-defined radios and show that LoPhy achieves a 0.57% bit error rate at a distance of 700 m without affecting the legitimate channel’s performance. Moreover, we present two applications enabled by LoPhy to demonstrate the potential of LoPhy. Compared with the state-of-the-art, LoPhy brings up to 18 \texttimes{} reduction of bit errors and 63 \texttimes{} gain on noise resilience.},

abstract = {TCP and TLS are among the essential protocols in today's Internet. TCP ensures reliable data delivery while TLS secures the data transfer. Although they are very often used together, they have been designed independently following the Internet layered model. This paper demonstrates the various benefits that a closer integration between TCP and TLS would bring.By leveraging the extensible TLS 1.3 records, we combine TCP and TLS into TCPLS to build modern transport services such as multiplexing, connection migration, stream steering, and bandwidth aggregation. These services do not modify the TCP wire format and are resistant to middleboxes. TCPLS offers a powerful API enabling applications to precisely express the required transport services, ranging from a single-path single-stream connection to a multi-stream connection over several network paths, enabling choices between aggregated bandwidth and head-of-line blocking avoidance.Compared to MPTCP, our TCPLS prototype offers more control to the application and can be easily deployed as an extension to user-space TLS libraries, while being implemented at a low cost. Measurements demonstrate that it offers higher performance than existing QUIC libraries with a super set of transport services.},

In this paper, we design and implement TinyNet, a lightweight, modular, and unified network architecture for representative low-power radio technologies including 802.15.4, BLE, and LoRa. The modular architecture of TinyNet allows us to simplify the creation of new protocols by selecting specific modules in TinyNet. We implement TinyNet on realistic IoT nodes including TI CC2650 and Heltec IoT LoRa nodes. We perform extensive evaluations. Results show that TinyNet (1) allows interoperability at or above the network layer; (2) allows code reuse for multi-protocol co-existence and simplifies new protocols design by module composition; (3) has a small code size and memory footprint.},

abstract = {Long communication range and low energy consumption are the two most important design goals of Low-power Wide-area Networks (LPWANs); however, many prior works have revealed that the performance of LPWAN in practical scenarios is not satisfactory. Although there are PHY-layer and link-layer approaches proposed to improve the performance of LPWAN, they either rely heavily on the hardware modifications or suffer from low data recovery capability, especially with bursty packet loss patterns. In this article, we propose a practical system, eLoRa, for COTS devices. eLoRa utilizes rateless codes and joint decoding with multiple gateways to extend the communication range and lifetime of LoRaWAN. To further improve the performance of LoRaWAN, eLoRa optimizes parameters of the PHY-layer (e.g., spreading factor) and the link layer (e.g, block length). We implement eLoRa on COTS LoRa devices and conduct extensive experiments on an outdoor testbed to evaluate the effectiveness of eLoRa. Results show that eLoRa can effectively improve the communication range of DaRe and LoRaWAN by 43.2% and 55.7% with a packet reception ratio higher than 60%, and increase the expected lifetime of DaRe and LoRaWAN by 18.3% and 46.6%.},

abstract = {IoT is developing rapidly with frequently appearing new wireless standards and applications. However, besides a large number of IoT benefits, its further development is now being slowed down due to the repetition of old Internet development flaws while dealing with IoT heterogeneity. The current misleading trend aims to solve all IoT interoperation problems by inserting IP Addresses into those wireless protocols where the IP stack clearly slows down application performance and drains the battery, e.g. LPWANs such as LoRaWAN and SigFox. This paper tackles IoT heterogeneity from a different perspective: it is the application interoperation which matters the most. The protocols beneath the application layer shall work for smooth upper-layer service provisioning where the IP shall be just one of the many underlying integration options instead of being the essential one. Inspired by previous proposals for a more flexible internetworking architecture, this paper applies those theoretical concepts in practice by proposing a protocol-independent distributed interoperation model for smooth service provisioning over heterogeneous IoT wireless contexts. The arguments pro the IP-agnostic IoT application interoperation are supported by the model's prototype which showed 1.6-2 times faster MQTT application operation over LoRa and WiFi compared to the legacy IP-based MQTT provisioning over that protocols.},

abstract = {In wireless networking R&amp;D we typically depend on simulation and experimentation to evaluate and validate new networking solutions. While simulations allow full control over the scenario conditions, real-world experiments are influenced by external random phenomena and may produce hardly repeatable and reproducible results, impacting the validation of the solution under evaluation. Previously, we have proposed the Trace-based Simulation (TS) approach to address the problem. TS uses traces of radio link quality and position of nodes to accurately reproduce past experiments in ns-3. Yet, in its current version, the TS approach is not compatible with scenarios where the radio spectrum is shared with concurrent networks, as it does not reproduce their channel occupancy.In this paper, we introduce the InterferencePropagationLossModel and a modified MacLow to allow reproducing the channel occupancy observed in past experiments using Wi-Fi. To validate the proposed models, the network throughput was measured in different experiments performed in the w-iLab.t testbed, controlling the channel occupancy introduced by concurrent networks. The experimental results were then compared with the network throughput achieved using the improved TS approach, the legacy TS approach, and pure simulation, validating the new proposed models and confirming their relevance to reproduce experiments previously executed in real environments.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) power stations are usually deployed in remote areas, wherein the power production is adversely affected by natural disasters. Therefore, monitoring and analyzing the operation of PV power station requires the evolution of intelligent communication systems. However, due to the immature development of wireless Mesh networks, there is no unified communication scheme and transmission protocol established in remote intelligent monitoring. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we design a novel communication protocol for PV scenarios by transplanting the CONTIKI operating system on STM32. In particular, we integrate the LoRa terminal device with sensing monitoring to build an energy efficient wireless mesh framework. The designed system can effectively transmit the status of solar panels and the weather conditions to ensure the stability of the PV power plants. By coordinating the status of transmitting devices and designing the dual power supplies, the power consumption can be reduced. To confirm the practical value of the proposed framework, various routing algorithms were simulated using Cooja. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of achieving stable communication, and hence proves the capability for data transmission in various sensing and acquisition scenarios.},

abstract = {Named-Data Networking (NDN), a realization of the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) vision, offers a request-response communication model where data is identified based on application-defined names at the network layer. This amplifies the ability of censoring authorities to restrict access to certain data/websites/applications and monitor user requests. The majority of existing NDN-based frameworks have focused on enabling users in a censoring network to access data available outside of this network, without considering how data producers in a censoring network can make their data available to users outside of this network. This problem becomes especially challenging, since the NDN communication paths are symmetric, while producers are mandated to sign the data they generate and identify their certificates. In this paper, we propose Harpocrates, an NDN-based framework for anonymous data publication under censorship conditions. Harpocrates enables producers in censoring networks to produce and make their data available to users outside of these networks while remaining anonymous to censoring authorities. Our evaluation demonstrates that Harpocrates achieves anonymous data publication under different settings, being able to identify and adapt to censoring actions.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has seen rapid adoption of Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in lieu of Proof-of-Work due to the former’s efficiency and speed. One notable example of Proof-of-Stake is the Tendermint protocol, which has been powering the entirety of Cosmos system - an ecosystem of multiple interlocked chains. However, Tendermint’s choice of deterministically deciding the next block proposer presents a huge window for malicious actors to prepare and coordinate attacks on upcoming validator nodes, possibly crippling the attacked chain. Furthermore, randomized number generation in this blockchain ecosystem still proves to be a challenge by reason of blockchain’s inherent deterministic nature. Aiming at the above problems, in this paper, we propose an improvement over Tendermint consensus protocol, utilizing Elliptic Curve Verifiable Random Function, a fast and secure pseudorandom generation algorithm suitable for deterministic systems like blockchain. This novel approach will solve the problem of knowing the validator ahead of time, whilst the verifiable random function module will be capable of supplying reliable random numbers to the overlaying beacon chain - a blockchain capable of distributing random numbers to users through smart contracts, and even other blockchains through Cosmos’ InterBlockchain Communication Protocol. The performed experiments with a prototype blockchain demonstrated that the new consensus protocol improves Tendermint’s resilience against network-layer attack vectors, while maintaining adequate fairness and performance.},

Understanding the security of their machine-to-machine communication is crucial. Prior work focused on identifying devices’ vulnerabilities or proposed protocol-specific solutions. Instead, we investigate the security of backends speaking IoT protocols, that is, the backbone of the IoT ecosystem. We focus on three real-world protocols for our large-scale analysis: MQTT, CoAP, and XMPP. We gather a dataset of over 337,000 backends, augment it with geographical and provider data, and perform non-invasive active measurements to investigate three major security threats: information leakage, weak authentication, and denial of service. Our results provide quantitative evidence of a problematic immaturity in the IoT ecosystem. Among other issues, we find that 9.44% backends expose information, 30.38% CoAP-speaking backends are vulnerable to denial of service attacks, and 99.84% of MQTT- and XMPP-speaking backends use insecure transport protocols (only 0.16% adopt TLS, of which 70.93% adopt a vulnerable version).},

Such a benchmarking approach, however, does not cover the application integration challenge that arises from the many distributed applications sharing a network infrastructure, each with their individual topology and data structure. The paper addresses V2X networks as an important example. Crucial end-to-end application constraints including real-time and safety encourage a closer look at application interference and systematic integration. This perspective paper proposes a two-layer resource management that divides the problem into an application integration and a network management task. Valet parking with high-resolution infrastructure camera support is elaborated as a use case that overarches vehicle network and wireless network management. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of complementing the current network-centric management by an application-centric integration.},

abstract = {Recent proposals for reconfigurable data center networks have shown that providing multiple time-varying paths can improve network capacity and lower physical latency. However, existing TCP variants are ill-suited to utilize available capacity because their congestion control cannot react quickly enough to drastic variations in bandwidth and latency.We present Time-division TCP (TDTCP), a new TCP variant designed for reconfigurable data center networks. TDTCP recognizes that communication in these fabrics happens over a set of paths, each having its own physical characteristics and cross traffic. TDTCP multiplexes each connection across multiple independent congestion states---one for each distinct path---while managing connection-wide tasks in a shared fashion. It leverages network support to receive timely notification of path changes and promptly matches its local view to the current path. We implement TDTCP in the Linux kernel. Results on an emulated network show that TDTCP improves throughput over both traditional TCP variants, such as DCTCP and CUBIC, and multipath TCP by 24--41% without requiring significant in-network buffering to hide path variations.},

abstract = {Manufacturing processes are often monitored by IP cameras. The generated video streams can be transferred via a wireless link to be processed and used by remote industrial controllers that manage and configure the industrial task in real-time. However, the link has limited bandwidth and is not capable of transmitting the aggregated traffic of all the IP cameras. Moreover, the platform provider of the remote controller (e.g., cloud) might charge extra fees for high volumes of network traffic. To optimize the data transport, we propose an in-network video quality control method for IP camera streams that drops non-essential frames from temporally irrelevant IP camera streams even when bandwidth is available. Our solution introduces a high-level API through which the operator can define which camera streams are needed with high quality at which actuator positions/states of the industrial process. Our method assumes an aggregation point that monitors the actuators' states and reduces the quality of camera streams that are not important for the control process, selectively dropping a set of video frames. We have implemented a P4-based prototype of the aggregation point and show that the remote controller can be fed with high-quality video streams while meeting bandwidth limitations and potentially saving data transfer costs without modifying the end-points.},

abstract = {One of the most successful applications of peer-to-peer communication networks is in the context of blockchain protocols, which-in Satoshi Nakamoto's own words-rely on the "nature of information being easy to spread and hard to stifle." Significant efforts were invested in the last decade into analyzing the security of these protocols, and invariably the security arguments known for longest-chain Nakamoto-style consensus use an idealization of this tenet. Unfortunately, the real-world implementations of peer-topeer gossip-style networks used by blockchain protocols rely on a number of ad-hoc attack mitigation strategies that leave a glaring gap between the idealized communication layer assumed in formal security arguments for blockchains and the real world, where a wide array of attacks have been showcased.  In this work we bridge this gap by presenting a Byzantineresilient network layer for blockchain protocols. For the first time we quantify the problem of network-layer attacks in the context of blockchain security models, and we develop a design that thwarts resource-restricted adversaries. Importantly, we focus on the proofof- stake setting due to its vulnerability to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks stemming from the well-known deficiency (compared to the proof-of-work setting) known as nothing at stake.  We present a Byzantine-resilient gossip protocol, and we analyze it in the Universal Composition framework. In order to prove security, we show novel results on expander properties of random graphs. Importantly, our gossip protocol can be based on any given bilateral functionality that determines a desired interaction between two "adjacent" peers in the networking layer and demonstrates how it is possible to use application-layer information to make the networking-layer resilient to attacks. Despite the seeming circularity, we demonstrate how to prove the security of a Nakamoto-style longest-chain protocol given our gossip networking functionality, and hence, we demonstrate constructively how it is possible to obtain provable security across protocol layers, given only barebone point-to-point networking, majority of honest stake, and a verifiable random function.},

abstract = {This article extends the promising software-defined networking technology to wireless sensor networks to achieve two goals: 1) reducing the information exchange between the control and data planes, and 2) counterbalancing between the sender’s waiting-time and the duplicate packets. To this end and beyond the state-of-the-art, this work proposes an SDN-based architecture, namely MINI-SDN, that separates the control and data planes. Moreover, based on MINI-SDN, we propose MINI-FLOW, a communication protocol that orchestrates the computation of flows and data routing between the two planes. MINI-FLOW supports uplink, downlink and intra-link flows. Uplink flows are computed based on a heuristic function that combines four values, the hops to the sink, the Received Signal Strength (RSS), the direction towards the sink, and the remaining energy. As for the downlink flows, two heuristic algorithms are proposed, Optimized Reverse Downlink (ORD) and Location-based Downlink(LD). ORD employs the reverse direction of the uplink while LD instantiates the flows based on a heuristic function that combines three values, the distance to the end node, the remaining energy and RSS value. Intra-link flows employ a combination of uplink/downlink flows. The experimental results show that the proposed architectureand communication protocol perform and scale well with both network size and density, considering the joint problem of routing and load balancing.},

To provide higher bandwidth in in-vehicle communication networks, carmakers are choosing Ethernet technology, which becomes Automotive Ethernet (AE) when applied in in-vehicle communication networks. However, with the rise of vehicle connectivity, the cybersecurity of vehicle systems has become a primary concern for the automotive industry. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review, deeply analyzing the impact of AE on security and safety, and comparing it with the current in-vehicle communication solutions like Controller Area Network protocol. We retrieved the key security attacks and mitigations proposed in the current literature to highlight their significance, including a mapping between the regulation UNECE WP.29 R155 and the retrieved answers. We found that the industry has only implemented some automotive-dedicated Ethernet solutions to date. In the near future, the vehicle and road ecosystems may require more exclusive automotive solutions to meet specific constraints such as low latency. Our results can provide a comprehensive baseline, both for industry and academia, for the current and future development of AE.},

Its design goals are to overcome some of TCP's performance issues, while maintaining the same properties and basic application interface. Two of the main drivers of its success were the integration with the innovative Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) congestion control mechanism, and the possibility of multiplexing different application streams over the same connection. Given the strong interest in QUIC shown by the ns-3 community, we present an extension to the native QUIC module that allows researchers to fully explore the potential of these two features. In this work, we present the integration of BBR into the QUIC module and the implementation of the necessary pacing and rate sampling mechanisms, along with a novel scheduling interface, with three different scheduling flavors. The new features are tested to verify that they perform as expected, using a web traffic model from the literature.},

They are connected to the Internet through wired or wireless networks using the same network protocols. The IoT(Internet of Things) can monitor stress, temperature, pressure, image and other parameters of the surrounding environment through sensors. With the maturity of sensor technology, wireless sensor network, as the most promising technology, has many applications, including data acquisition and event detection. This paper proposes an improved design strategy based on the optimized particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the shortest path routing problem in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, MATLAB is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol. It is found that compared with LEACH(Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol, the protocol reduces packet loss by about 25%. The simulation results show that the IPSO(Improved Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm can improve the network coverage by 15.21%, while only 10 nodes need to be added to improve connectivity, and the network performance has been significantly improved.},

abstract = {Modern network infrastructure has evolved into a complex organism to satisfy the performance and availability requirements for the billions of users. Frequent releases such as code upgrades, bug fixes and security updates have become a norm. Millions of globally distributed infrastructure components including servers and load-balancers are restarted frequently from multiple times per-day to per-week. However, every release brings possibilities of disruptions as it can result in reduced cluster capacity, disturb intricate interaction of the components operating at large scales and disrupt the end-users by terminating their connections. The challenge is further complicated by the scale and heterogeneity of supported services and protocols.In this paper, we leverage different components of the end-to-end networking infrastructure to prevent or mask any disruptions in face of releases. Zero Downtime Release is a collection of mechanisms used at Facebook to shield the end-users from any disruptions, preserve the cluster capacity and robustness of the infrastructure when updates are released globally. Our evaluation shows that these mechanisms prevent any significant cluster capacity degradation when a considerable number of productions servers and proxies are restarted and minimizes the disruption for different services (notably TCP, HTTP and publish/subscribe).},

abstract = {Page load time is a web performance metric that directly impacts user experience. It measures the time it takes to fully load a web page after making a request. However, as the first visual feedback of a web page, first rendering time is also a key metric to satisfy the users. In this paper, we focus on speeding up the first rendering time in page loading from the perspective of protocol improvements. We observe that by prioritizing the streams that make up the critical rendering path in Multipath-QUIC (MPQUIC), the first rendering time can be effectively reduced. Therefore, we propose PriorityBucket - an MPQUIC scheduler that provides stream prioritization in the transport layer. By comparing to the existing schedulers of MPQUIC, we show its effectiveness in reducing the first rendering time and page load time of web pages in different path heterogeneity using the Chrome browser. Results show that PriorityBucket can reduce the first rendering time and page load time up to 34% and 35% respectively in high path heterogeneity when loading Bing.},

abstract = {Remote SIM provisioning (RSP) for consumer devices is the protocol specified by the GSM Association for downloading SIM profiles into a secure element in a mobile device. The process is commonly known as eSIM, and it is expected to replace removable SIM cards. The security of the protocol is critical because the profile includes the credentials with which the mobile device will authenticate to the mobile network. In this article, we present a formal security analysis of the consumer RSP protocol. We model the multi-party protocol in applied pi calculus, define formal security goals, and verify them in ProVerif. The analysis shows that the consumer RSP protocol protects against a network adversary when all the intended participants are honest. However, we also model the protocol in realistic partial compromise scenarios where the adversary controls a legitimate participant or communication channel. The security failures in the partial compromise scenarios reveal weaknesses in the protocol design. The most important observation is that the security of RSP depends unnecessarily on it being encapsulated in a TLS tunnel. Also, the lack of pre-established identifiers means that a compromised download server anywhere in the world or a compromised secure element can be used for attacks against RSP between honest participants. Additionally, the lack of reliable methods for verifying user intent can lead to serious security failures. Based on the findings, we recommend practical improvements to RSP implementations, future versions of the specification, and mobile operator processes to increase the robustness of eSIM security.},

abstract = {IETF QUIC, the standardized version of Google’s UDP-based layer-4 network protocol, has seen increasing adoption from large Internet companies for its benefits over TCP. Yet despite its rapid adoption, performance analysis of QUIC in production is scarce. Most existing analyses have only used unoptimized open-source QUIC servers on non-tuned kernels: these analyses are unrepresentative of production deployments which raises the question of whether QUIC actually outperforms TCP in practice. In this paper, we conduct one of the first comparative studies on the performance of QUIC and TCP against production endpoints hosted by Google, Facebook, and Cloudflare under various dimensions: network conditions, workloads, and client implementations. To understand our results, we create a tool to systematically visualize the root causes of performance differences between the two protocols. Using our tool we make several key observations. First, while QUIC has some inherent advantages over TCP, such as worst-case 1-RTT handshakes, its overall performance is largely determined by the server’s choice of congestion-control algorithm and the robustness of its congestion-control implementation under edge-case network scenarios. Second, we find that some QUIC clients require non-trivial configuration tuning in order to achieve optimal performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that QUIC’s removal of head-of-line (HOL) blocking has little impact on web-page performance in practice. Taken together, our observations illustrate the fact that QUIC’s performance is inherently tied to implementation design choices, bugs, and configurations which implies that QUIC measurements are not always a reflection of the protocol and often do not generalize across deployments.},

Despite the widespread use, security research of 5G messaging remains sparse. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis and measurement of 5G messaging services, assisted by a semi-automated testing tool we developed. We considered both carrier-side deployment and phone-side software implementations by testing against three large operators, each with hundreds of millions of subscribers, and six popular 5G messaging-enabled devices. We uncovered 4 categories of vulnerabilities, allowing for a wide range of attacks, including Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, zero-click remote information leakage, phone storage exhaustion and mobile data consumption, and Denial-of-Services (DoS) attacks. Our study underscores the need for further security enhancements in security specifications, implementation, and deployment of 5G messaging services.},

This paper introduces multicast address firstly. Secondly, it puts forward the IGMP snooping. Finally, the implementation of audio / video in campus network multimedia system is given by using Java Media Framework (JMF) technology. At present, the system works well, and the audio / video transmission is smooth and natural. Using Ethernet peek real-time network protocol analyzer to monitor data packets, verify the feasibility of the two-layer multicast scheme, the system realizes true layer-2 multicast.},

abstract = {After nearly five years and 34 draft versions, standardization of the new connection oriented transport protocol QUIC was finalized in May 2021. Designed as a fundamental network protocol with increased complexity due to the combination of functionality from multiple network stack layers, it has the potential to drastically influence the Internet ecosystem. Nevertheless, even in its early stages, the protocol attracted a variety of parties including large providers. Our study shows, that more than 2.3 M IPv4 and 300k IPv6 addresses support QUIC hosting more than 30 M domains.Using our newly implemented stateful QUIC scanner (QScanner) we are able to successfully scan 26 M targets. We show that TLS as an integral part is similarly configured between QUIC and TLS over TCP stacks for the same target. In comparison, we identify 45 widely varying transport parameter configurations, e.g., with differences in the order of magnitudes for performance relevant parameters. Combining these configurations with HTTP Server header values and associated domains reveals two large edge deployments from Facebook and Google. Thus, while found QUIC deployments are located in 4667 autonomous systems, numerous of these are again operated by large providers.In our experience, IETF QUIC already sees an advanced deployment status mainly driven by large providers. We argue that the current deployment state and diversity of existing implementations and seen configurations solidifies the importance of QUIC as a future research topic. In this work, we provide and evaluate a versatile tool set, to identify QUIC capable hosts and their properties.Besides the stateful QScanner we present and analyze a newly implemented IPv4 and IPv6 ZMap module. We compare it to additional detection methods based on HTTP Alternative Service Header values from HTTP handshakes and DNS scans of the newly drafted HTTPS DNS resource record. While each method reveals unique deployments the latter would allow lightweight scans to detect QUIC capable targets but is drastically biased towards Cloudflare.},

abstract = {Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) are considered to be ad-hoc network formed by Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs). FANETs are widely used in both military and civilian domains, like surveillance or emergency response. Due to the highly dynamic movement of UAVs in FANETs, communication protocols must be thoroughly tested before deployment. To ensure consistent performance, thorough testing must be performed in both simulated and real-world contexts. In this study, the FANS (Flying Ad-hoc Network Simulator) co-simulation platform is expanded. This platform combines ns-3 network simulation, ROS robotics software development, and Gazebo drone simulation. It is further connected to hardware emulation using an embedded system platform, which includes the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Pixhawk-4 flight controller. The simulation framework is designed to measure important network parameters such as end-to-end delay and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) in a decentralized Wi-Fi ad-hoc network setup. In addition to the simulation, a hardware testbed consisting of three drones is created. In this configuration, UAVs communicate while flying in a straight line formation. The findings of this real-world implementation are contrasted with those acquired through simulation. The simulation and hardware test results are presented to show that the hardware integration was successful. This work lays the groundwork for future research and testing of various networking protocols in FANETs.},

abstract = {The majority of secure messengers have single, centralized service providers that relay ciphertexts between users to enable asynchronous communication. However, in some scenarios such as mass protests in censored networks, relying on a centralized provider is fatal. Mesh messengers attempt to solve this problem by building ad hoc networks in which user clients perform the ciphertext-relaying task. Yet, recent analyses of widely deployed mesh messengers discover severe security weaknesses (Albrecht et al. CT-RSA'21 &amp; USENIX Security'22).To support the design of secure mesh messengers, we provide a new, more complete security model for mesh messaging. Our model captures forward and post-compromise security, as well as forward and post-compromise anonymity, both of which are especially important in this setting. We also identify novel, stronger confidentiality goals that can be achieved due to the special characteristics of mesh networks (e.g., delayed communication, distributed network and adversary).Finally, we develop a new protocol, called ASMesh, that provably satisfies these security goals. For this, we revisit Signal's Double Ratchet and propose non-trivial enhancements. On top of that, we add a mechanism that provides forward and post-compromise anonymity. Thus, our protocol efficiently provides strong confidentiality and anonymity under past and future user corruptions. Most of our results are also applicable to traditional messaging.We prove security of our protocols and evaluate their performance in simulated mesh networks. Finally, we develop a proof of concept implementation.},

While existing Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocols provide fault-tolerant mechanisms, they face challenges in hybrid application scenarios such as high communication complexity, complex endpoint replicas, and expensive trusted hardware deployment costs. We proposes TSW-BFT, a consensus protocol based on trusted switches. By introducing trusted switch components at the data path layer combined with threshold cryptography, it reduces the total number of replicas required to tolerate f Byzantine replicas to 2f+1. The proposed algorithm provides general consensus services for numerous regular replicas using limited trusted hardware, and implements high-safety modes and membership management mechanisms to support dynamic mode switching in hybrid scenarios. Results indicate that the TSW-BFT algorithm reduces consensus latency by 23% compared to PBFT and by 42.3% compared to MinBFT.},

Therefore, this paper review the related works in this filed and provides the main design issues that should be considered when designing such protocols. This paper also propose a Bus-based WSMP (WAVE Short Messages) dissemination approach. To implement this approach a realistic mobility model is built using bi-directional coupled technique. The performance Bus-based proposed model is evaluated in order to design an efficient algorithm for service discovery protocol that utilizes the public bus networks. The results of the realistic simulation model are compared with mathematical framework. It is shown that the bus outperforms other vehicles in beacon delivering ratio. Therefore, the idea of using public buses in addition to the beaconing approach can be used in future work for designing efficient algorithms in the field of vehicular networks.},

abstract = {In the era of big data, privacy-preserving deep neural network (DNN) training has emerged as a critical research area. Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) has become a key technique for enabling collaborative model training while safeguarding data confidentiality. However, the high communication overhead inherent in SMPC protocols poses a substantial obstacle to their practical deployment, particularly in large-scale deep learning applications. To address this challenge, we propose ESMPC, a computation–communication co-optimization framework designed to enhance communication efficiency in SMPC-based DNN training. Within ESMPC, we propose SecurePipe, a novel pipeline-parallelism strategy tailored for SMPC-based DNN training. SecurePipe effectively improves both model and data parallelism, enabling parallel computation and communication under encryption, thereby enhancing overall training throughput and significantly improving GPU utilization. To further reduce communication costs, we design three communication optimization algorithms specifically targeting both linear and non-linear operations. Additionally, we propose two protocol-level optimizations that substantially lower communication overhead during secure training. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of ESMPC. In two-party computation settings, ESMPC reduces the training time of AlexNet by over 30%, and achieves more than 45% reduction for FCNN, LeNet, and ViT. Similarly, in three-party computation settings, the training time for all four models is reduced by over 45%, demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of the proposed framework in real-world SMPC training environments.},

abstract = {Security function outsourcing has witnessed both research and deployment in the recent years. While most existing services take a straight-forward approach of cloud hosting, on-path transit networks (such as ISPs) are increasingly more interested in offering outsourced security services to end users. Recent proposals (e.g., SafeBricks&nbsp;[40] and mbTLS&nbsp;[34]) have made it possible to outsource sensitive security applications to untrusted, arbitrary networks, rendering on-path security function outsourcing more promising than ever. However, to provide on-path security function outsourcing, there is one crucial component that is still missing — a practical end-to-end network protocol. Thus, the discovery and orchestration of multiple capable and willing transit networks for user-requested security functions have only been assumed in many studies without any practical solutions. In this work, we propose Opsec, an end-to-end security-outsourcing protocol that fills this gap and brings us closer to the vision of on-path security function outsourcing. Opsec automatically discovers one or more transit ISPs between a client and a server, and requests user-specified security functions efficiently. When designing Opsec, we prioritize the practicality and applicability of this new end-to-end protocol in the current Internet. Our proof-of-concept implementation of Opsec for web sessions shows that an end user can easily start a new web session with a few clicks of a browser plug-in, to specify a series of security functions of her choice. We show that it is possible to implement such a new end-to-end service model in the current Internet for the majority of the web services without any major changes to the standard protocols (e.g., TCP, TLS, HTTP) and the existing network infrastructure (e.g., ISP’s routing primitives).},

abstract = {Recently, LoRa mesh networks have gained increasing interest as a communication layer for sending data between IoT nodes. However, the network service of the firmware on the microcontroller-based nodes is typically limited to sending and receiving LoRa packets through the LoRa radio. Therefore, the packet processing by the node has to be done using an application-specific implementation. In this article, we present the design and implementation of a middleware that facilitates the development and operation of multiple distributed applications on LoRa mesh network nodes. The components we propose leverage the routing capacity of a LoRa mesh network enabled by the LoRaMesher library and provide a service for applications to send and receive messages from each other. Running several applications concurrently is also supported. We experiment with the middleware implemented in the node firmware with distributed applications that span from the LoRa mesh network to the Internet over MQTT. Our results show the support of bidirectional application-level communication, which can be used to build cross-network distributed applications that integrate services on LoRa mesh network nodes.},

abstract = {The autonomous driving system is both a real-time and safety-critical system. Performance bugs in such systems can lead to serious accidents. However, when a performance problem occurs, it is challenging to analyze due to the difficulty in obtaining runtime data. In this work, we propose AutoTracer, a low-overhead end-to-end tracing framework helping developers analyze performance issues at each layer of the autonomous driving system. To make AutoTracer practical for deployment in autonomous vehicles, we have introduced several optimizations to control its time and space overhead, ensuring minimal impact on system performance. Our evaluation of AutoTracer on a real-world industrial autonomous driving system demonstrates that its impact on the end-to-end latency of autonomous driving system is consistently less than 1.2% in terms of average, p90, p99, maximum, and standard deviation values, making it suitable for in-vehicle deployment. Furthermore, with the deployment of AutoTracer, our engineers have reduced the p99 long-tail latency of our autonomous driving system by 300 ms through identifying and addressing a set of high-impact performance bugs.},

To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of related works from both academia and industry.

abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is present in many participants from the energy, health, manufacturing, transport, and public sectors. Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments.},

abstract = {Internet of Things technology refers to connecting different types of physical devices, sensors, and other devices together through the Internet to achieve real-time data exchange, thereby achieving real-time monitoring and data analysis. With the continuous development of internet technology, the IoT technology is becoming an important component of future smart homes, smart cities, and Industry 4.0 fields. There are multiple communication protocols and data formats between IoT devices, and a large number of monolithic structures lead to issues such as insufficient scalability and flexibility, resulting in a large number of security vulnerabilities in IoT communication, threatening network security and data privacy. Microservices technology splits a single application into multiple small services that run in separate processes, using lightweight communication mechanisms between services. The interaction between microservices uses standard communication technology, which can enhance the scalability and security of IoT device applications. This article proposes a microservice based security access model that enables fine-grained access decisions, effectively reducing attacks related to IoT device connections and data security, and providing scalable, reconfigurable, and reusable security services. We analyzed the feasibility, reliability, and efficiency of the proposed scheme through theoretical analysis and experiments. The CPU and memory usage of microservices was tested, as well as microservices concurrency performance. The experimental results show that the proposed microservices can achieve corresponding functions and return device data. The microservice scheme designed in this article can meet normal access requests and security communication.},

abstract = {Biodiversity conservation in fragmented and remote ecosystems often requires labour-intensive, time-consuming fieldwork, placing staff at risk and limiting the scope of long-term monitoring. To address these challenges in a sustainable, locally adaptable manner, we present BearWave, a novel, place-based HF communication framework attuned to local infrastructure constraints and designed to support low-power sensing networks under severe radio-frequency (RF) conditions. By leveraging Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) propagation and the FT8 digital modulation technique, BearWave achieves reliable, bidirectional data transfer—even in dense tropical rainforest conditions—while keeping costs under £200 per node and enabling extended battery-powered operation. A case study in UK woodlands, chosen as an environmental analogue to Borneo’s rainforest, demonstrated BearWave’s robustness and adaptability: despite dense vegetation and non-line-of-sight paths, the system maintained over 90% message reliability at distances of up to 25 km using only 1 W of RF power. Notably, the strongest signal propagation and best reception rates occurred during nighttime, reflecting diurnal ionospheric variations. These empirical results confirm that BearWave outperforms conventional technologies such as LoRaWAN or satellite systems in harsh, attenuating environments, offering a scalable, energy-efficient approach that lowers both ecological footprints and staff labor risks. This research advances conservation-focused communication by providing a universal, scientifically validated framework capable of supporting long-term ecological monitoring, poacher detection, and improved animal welfare. Crucially, BearWave’s low-cost, low-impact design broadens access for under-resourced organisations and community-driven conservation programs, where local knowledge and stakeholder insights help shape technology decisions on the ground. By embracing a socio-technical innovation model, BearWave exemplifies how computing can be sustainably embedded in remote ecosystems worldwide.},

The problem this paper addresses is how to provide each user a continuously fresh, up-to-date view of the parts of the social graph they are currently interested in, so as to provide a positive interactive user experience. The problem is challenging because the social graph mutates at a high rate, users change their focus of interest frequently, and some mutations are of interest to many online users.We describe Bladerunner, a system we use at Facebook to deliver relevant social graph updates to user devices efficiently and quickly. The heart of Bladerunner is a set of back-end stream processors that obtain streams of social graph updates and process them on a per application and per-user basis before pushing selected updates to user devices. Separate stream processors are used for each application to enable application-specific customization, complex filtering, aggregation and other message delivery operations on a per-user basis. This strategy minimizes device processing overhead and last-mile bandwidth usage, which are critical given that users are mostly on mobile devices.},

This study analytically discusses the currently available MCPS models, threat scenarios, attacks, and data breach statistics to evaluate the current security situation of the research community in the MCPS domain. The large and complex components of MCPS comprise many computational and physical aspects, making managing secure reliability challenging. To address this challenge, there is a need for security by design that incorporates built-in security functionality in the development of an MCPS. Our comprehensive review critically analyzes the current state-of-the-art in MCPS by considering various aspects, such as functionality, communication media, design characteristics, and security. Furthermore, we explore the security threats posed by MCPS as well as their potential impact. Finally, we propose a potential future pathway to effectively mitigate the identified threats by providing a promising direction for further investigation.},

abstract = {Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a recent development in identity and access management that is based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and offers individuals and organizations control over their data. In contrast, Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) provide a platform for sharing radio infrastructure and data between users and mobile network operators (MNOs). Therefore, the integration of SSI with O-RAN provides an opportunity for decentralized, secure identity management that promotes a more transparent, efficient, and user-centric network environment. First, we propose the general architecture and perform a detailed threat model and security analysis, in which we identify the potential vulnerabilities and explain how our multi-layered security strategy mitigates these risks. The authentication process is also strengthened by the integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to ensure quantum-resistant security. We have carried out simulations to evaluate the efficiency of our system for credential operations, revealing that the average time for most credential operations is within a reasonable range (between 39- 750 ms), even when the request volume increases to 100,000. The proposed system efficiently maintains credential offering, presentation, connection creations, signing, and credential revocation times, which emphasizes its ability to effectively balance security and performance. In addition, our QKD simulations show several key management performance metrics. In the impact discussions, we address the potential integration of QKD into the authentication process to significantly increase security, with the system effectively managing key management and authentication times in a scalable manner. In addition, at the end of the paper, we discuss challenges, rationales, and technical aspects in O-RAN environments.},

abstract = {In smart cities, the most important factor in connecting and controlling various devices and services is interworking the data and managing systematic integration. The smart city includes the Internet of things (IoT) devices in various domains, such as smart metering, smart grids, health care, logistics, and transport. However, interoperability among devices in different domains is difficult due to the lack of common standards. In particular, interoperability in IoT environments is divided into several types (e.g., semantic, syntactic, network, and middleware), and each has different requirements. Therefore, interoperability issues should be identified on different levels, and the requirements should be proposed differently for each type. In this paper, we applied the interoperability types in the IoT environment to the smart city. In addition, we derived the requirements for five types of interoperability in a smart city based on various interoperability studies in the IoT environment. Consequently, we presented the five interoperability types (i.e., syntactic, semantic, network, middleware, and security) by adding common security for each type and presented the requirements that satisfy various interoperability issues in the smart city.},

Traditional TCP and UDP protocols are not suitable for these applications, because they are mainly designed for content delivery or non real-time interactive applications. Some ideas from transport protocols for real-time multimedia like RTP are closer to Tactile Internet; however, they do not satisfy requirements of low latency and high reliability. In this paper, we present the Multi-connection Tactile Internet Protocol (MTIP), a novel transport protocol on top of the Internet Protocol to support the reliability and latency for Internet applications over multi-homed devices connected to several wireless networks. In order to provide that service, MTIP is based on the combination of sequence numbers and timestamps in packets, enhanced with global clocks and context awareness. The paper focuses on building a state machine based model of MTIP to prove the correct behaviour of the protocol using the SPIN tool to verify a number of relevant correctness properties.},

abstract = {Since the advent of software-defined networking (SDN), Traffic Engineering (TE) has been highlighted as one of the key applications that can be achieved through software-controlled protocols (e.g. PCEP and MPLS). Being one of the most complex challenges in networking, TE problems involve difficult decisions such as allocating flows, either via splitting them among multiple paths or by using a reservation system, to minimize congestion. However, creating an optimized solution is cumbersome and difficult as traffic patterns vary and change with network scale, capacity, and demand. AI methods can help alleviate this by finding optimized TE solutions for the best network performance. SDN-based TE tools such as Teal, Hecate and more, use classification techniques or deep reinforcement learning to find optimal network TE solutions that are demonstrated in simulation. Routing control conducted via source routing tools, e.g., PolKA, can help dynamically divert network flows. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Hecate to practically demonstrate TE on a real network, collaborating with PolKA, a source routing tool. With real-time traffic statistics, Hecate uses this data to compute optimal paths that are then communicated to PolKA to allocate flows. Several contributions are made to show a practical implementation of how this framework is tested using an emulated ecosystem mimicking a real P4 testbed scenario. This work proves valuable for truly engineered self-driving networks helping translate theory to practice.},

Network researchers and engineers need to create highly tailored protocols targeting individual problem domains. Existing library-based approaches either fall short on the flexibility in features or offer them at a significant performance overhead. To address this challenge, we present NetBlocks, a domain-specific language, and compiler for designing ad-hoc protocols and generating their highly optimized host network stack implementations. NetBlocks DSL input allows users to configure protocols by selecting and customizing features. Unlike other DSL compilers, NetBlocks also allows network researchers to extend the system and add more features easily without any prior compiler knowledge. Our design and implementation employ a high-performance Aspect-Oriented Programming framework written with the staging framework BuildIt. We also introduce a novel Layout Customization Layer that allows "staging packet layouts" alongside the implementation, which is critical for getting the best performance out of the protocol when possible, while allowing the practitioners to maintain compatibility with existing protocol layers where needed. Our evaluations on three applications ranging across deployments in data centers and underwater acoustic networks demonstrate a trade-off between performance (both latency and throughput) and selected features allowing the user to only pay-for-what-they-use.},

abstract = {Containers, an emerging service to manage and deploy applications into isolated boxes, are quickly increasing in popularity in the cloud and edge computing. In order to provide connectivity among multiple hosts, cloud providers adopt overlay networks, which not only impose significant overhead in throughput and latency in containerized applications, but also consume more CPU resources of the system. Through profiling and code analysis, this paper reveals that the overwhelming interrupts, as well as its load imbalance in the kernel processing contribute to the inefficiency of the container overlay networks. Specifically, every packet in container networks might raise multiple software interrupts compared to that in VM networks. Our results indicate that the container network throughput drops 2/3 and the tail latency increases more than 37 times if the interrupt overhead is not well optimized.},

This type of networks is vastly different from terrestrial wireless sensor networks and tremendous work have accelerated the realization. However, very few works study the issue of underwater data collection and network nodes control, which is crucial in many real applications. This calls for a new underwater acoustic network design. In this paper we present a Wi-Fi based underwater acoustic network, called uw-WiFi. which is robust, highly customizable, energy efficient to tackle the real harsh underwater environment and meet the diverse application requirements. We first give a detailed design of uw-WiFi including the network architecture and protocols at different layers. Following that, we conduct a case study with 5 different kinds of network nodes. The network has been tested in the real environments. The results show that the uw-WiFi network is not only able to meet the current urgent application needs but also achieve a satisfying network performance.},

abstract = {We present FLAIR, a novel approach for accelerating read operations in leader-based consensus protocols. FLAIR leverages the capabilities of the new generation of programmable switches to serve reads from follower replicas without compromising consistency. The core of the new approach is a packet-processing pipeline that can track client requests and system replies, identify consistent replicas, and at line speed, forward read requests to replicas that can serve the read without sacrificing linearizability. An additional benefit of FLAIR is that it facilitates devising novel consistency-aware load balancing techniques. Following the new approach, we designed FlairKV, a key-value store atop Raft. FlairKV implements the processing pipeline using the P4 programming language. We evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach and compare it to previous approaches using a cluster with a Barefoot Tofino switch. Our evaluation indicates that, compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, the proposed approach can bring significant performance gains: up to 42% higher throughput and 35–97% lower latency for most workloads. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that our novel load balancing techniques can cope with heterogeneous load and hardware to achieve higher performance, and that FLAIR can scale to support large data sets and clusters.},

abstract = {Personal computers (PC) and gadgets have recently become increasingly associated with the Internet. Internet Protocol (IP) has become the driving force for a decade for which devices and organizations tend to rely as a means of communication between hosts or nodes. Thus, it becomes necessary to have a reliable Protocol that will adapt to changes.In a network, an IP address is assigned to each interface that connects to the Internet. Addresses are still assigned using Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 has demonstrated reliability, compatibility with a wide range of protocols, applications and ease of implementation. IPv4 was supposed to cover all network interfaces, but with a huge increase in the number of devices (computer, mobile phone, tablet, routers, servers and etc.), the reserve of assigned addresses will be exhausted. IPv6 has been deployed to provide new services and to support network growth. This paper compares the key IPv4 and IPv6 specifications, compares the IPv4 and IPv6 header fields and compares the header structure.This article discusses the main problems and difficulties in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, and describes the methods of translation and tunneling.},

For industrial control systems filled with a large number of private protocols, accurate information on the format of private industrial control protocols is the basis of its security analysis. How to effectively analyze the format of private industrial control protocols is the key point to be solved in the security of the current industrial control system. In this paper, a private industrial control protocol formats analysis method based on Long short-term memory Fully convolutional neural network (LSTM-FCN) is proposed. The Long short-term memory Fully convolutional neural network (LSTM-FCN) model is used to learn the field types of public industrial control protocols. The trained model is then applied to the private industrial control protocols field type identification. Finally, the type recognition fields are fused based on the format characteristics of the public protocol fields. The results of the format analysis of the private industrial control protocol were obtained. The experimental results show that the method can accurately analyze the format of private industrial control protocols.},

abstract = {QUIC is expected to be a game-changer in improving web application performance. In this paper, we conduct a systematic examination of QUIC's performance over high-speed networks. We find that over fast Internet, the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 stack suffers a data rate reduction of up to 45.2% compared to the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 counterpart. Moreover, the performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2 grows as the underlying bandwidth increases. We observe this issue on lightweight data transfer clients and major web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera), on different hosts (desktop, mobile), and over diverse networks (wired broadband, cellular). It affects not only file transfers, but also various applications such as video streaming (up to 9.8% video bitrate reduction) and web browsing. Through rigorous packet trace analysis and kernel- and user-space profiling, we identify the root cause to be high receiver-side processing overhead, in particular, excessive data packets and QUIC's user-space ACKs. We make concrete recommendations for mitigating the observed performance issues.},

abstract = {IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.},

In the investigation, green computing for resource management and allocation issues is only discussed. Therefore, in the context of the 5G communication network, the investigation of the data classification and resource optimization of the Internet of Things are conducted. Method: The virtualization architecture of the heterogeneous wireless network resource based on 5G technology is designed. The related investigation is conducted based on 5G network and Internet of Things technology. Under the traditional method, the transfer learning is introduced to improve the AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) algorithm to classify the data. The investigated complete resource reuse method is used to optimize resources. A method that a sub-channel can be reused by a cellular link and any number of D2D links at the same time is proposed to conduct resource optimization investigation. Results: The investigation indicates that the classification accuracy of the algorithm is excellent for the data classification of the Internet of Things and has different advantages in various aspects compared with other algorithms. The designed algorithm can find a larger set of resource reuse and have a significant increase in spectrum utilization efficiency. Conclusion: The investigation can contribute to the boom in the Internet of Things in terms of data classification and resource optimization based on 5G.},

IoT affords the potential to couple machine-to-machine intercommunication and real-time information-gathering within the industry domain. Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution.

abstract = {The scalability and interoperability challenges in current cryptocurrencies have motivated the design of cryptographic protocols that enable efficient applications on top and across widely used cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Examples of such protocols include (virtual) payment channels, atomic swaps, oracle-based contracts, deterministic wallets, and coin mixing services. Many of these protocols are built upon minimal core functionalities supported by a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Most prominently, adaptor signatures (AS) have emerged as a powerful tool for constructing blockchain protocols that are (mostly) agnostic to the specific logic of the underlying cryptocurrency. Even though AS-based protocols are built upon the same cryptographic principles, there exists no modular and faithful way for reasoning about their security. Instead, all the works analyzing such protocols focus on reproving how adaptor signatures are used to cryptographically link transactions while considering highly simplified blockchain models that do not capture security-relevant aspects of transaction execution in blockchain-based consensus.To help this, we present LedgerLocks, a framework for the secure design of AS-based blockchain applications in the presence of a realistic blockchain. LedgerLocks defines the concept of AS-locked transactions, transactions whose publication is bound to the knowledge of a cryptographic secret. We argue that AS-locked transactions are the common building block of AS-based blockchain protocols and we define GLedgerLocks a realistic ledger model in the Universal Composability framework with built-in support for AS-locked transactions. As LedgerLocks abstracts from the cryptographic realization of AS-locked transactions, it allows protocol designers to focus on the blockchain-specific security considerations instead.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) and Network Softwarization are fast becoming core technologies of information systems and network management for the next-generation Internet. The deployment and applications of IoT range from smart cities to urban computing and from ubiquitous healthcare to tactile Internet. For this reason, the physical infrastructure of heterogeneous network systems has become more complicated and thus requires efficient and dynamic solutions for management, configuration, and flow scheduling. Network softwarization in the form of Software Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization has been extensively researched for IoT in the recent past. In this article, we present a systematic and comprehensive review of virtualization techniques explicitly designed for IoT networks. We have classified the literature into software-defined networks designed for IoT, function virtualization for IoT networks, and software-defined IoT networks. These categories are further divided into works that present architectural, security, and management solutions. Besides, the article highlights several short-term and long-term research challenges and open issues related to the adoption of software-defined Internet of Things.},

abstract = {As a transformative technology across various industries, the metaverse has emerged to connect the physical world with the virtual world. During this process, the Internet of Things (IoT) has played a critical role in achieving effective cyber-physical interaction. However, its prevalent centralized interconnection architectures encounter challenges related to interoperability and data privacy, consequently limiting their full potential in human-to-human interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel decentralized group-oriented data interconnection network for IoT systems, abbreviated as DeGONet. We propose a group-based trust management model to facilitate user adaptability in data-sharing practices. Additionally, we present a new interaction paradigm based on smart contracts and oracles. Recognizing the potential latency and scalability limitations of existing blockchain structures in large-scale data integration, we devise a novel blockchain structure called Direct Acyclic Graph Tree (DAG-Tree) and a novel consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Verification. These contributions enhance data security while mitigating the hardware and development costs associated with decentralized systems. Through rigorous performance analysis and comparative experiments, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework in large-scale data interconnection scenarios.},

Research centers, universities, industries and governments are working hard on the development of more scalable and efficient quantum communications networks, as well as the standardization of protocols, processes and interfaces needed for its industrialization. Many are the definitions of what will be the quantum Internet of the future (its architecture and components), but we offer a more relaxed definition of this concept, so that it is already possible to have a primitive QI with the technology available today, but without all the functionalities and components that will have in the future. As an example, the Madrid Quantum Network meets the requirements of this basic QI, proving to be a first step towards more complex architectures and functionalities. In addition, this concept has direct application as an intranet in restricted military environments, where high levels of security are required and whose extension is limited to metropolitan areas.},

abstract = {Routing plays a fundamental role in network applications, but it is especially challenging in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). These are a kind of mobile ad hoc networks made of, e.g., (possibly, unmanned) vehicles and humans where, despite a lack of continuous connectivity, data must be transmitted while the network conditions change due to the nodes’ mobility. In these contexts, routing is NP-hard and is usually solved by heuristic “store and forward” replication-based approaches, where multiple copies of the same message are moved and stored across nodes in the hope that at least one will reach its destination. Still, the existing routing protocols produce relatively low delivery probabilities. Here, we genetically improve two routing protocols widely adopted in DTNs, namely, Epidemic and PRoPHET, in the attempt to optimize their delivery probability. First, we dissect them into their fundamental components, i.e., functionalities such as checking if a node can transfer data, or sending messages to all connections. Then, we apply Genetic Improvement (GI) to manipulate these components as terminal nodes of evolving trees. We apply this methodology, in silico, to six test cases of urban networks made of hundreds of nodes and find that GI produces consistent gains in delivery probability in four cases. We then verify if this improvement entails a worsening of other relevant network metrics, such as latency and buffer time. Finally, we compare the logics of the best evolved protocols with those of the baseline protocols, and we discuss the generalizability of the results across test cases.},

abstract = {Eavesdroppers can exploit exposed packet headers towards attacks that profile clients and their data flows. In this paper, we propose FOG, a framework for effective full and partial header blinding using MIMO, to thwart eavesdroppers. FOG effectively tracks header bits as they traverse physical (PHY) layer sub-systems that perform functions like scrambling and interleaving. It combines multiple blinding signals for more effective and less predictable obfuscation, as compared to using a fixed blinding signal. We implement FOG on the WARP platform and demonstrate via extensive experiments that it yields better obfuscation than prior schemes that deploy full packet blinding. It causes a bit error rate (BER) of &gt; 40 % at an eavesdropper if two blinding streams are sent during header transmissions. Furthermore, even with full header blinding, FOG incurs a very small throughput hit of ≈5% with one blinding stream (and 9 % with two streams). Full packet blinding incurs much higher throughput hits (25 % with one stream and 50 % with two streams).},

abstract = {Cloud platform services must simultaneously be scalable, meet low tail latency service-level objectives, and be resilient to a combination of software, hardware, and network failures. Replication plays a fundamental role in meeting both the scalability and the fault-tolerance requirement, but is subject to opposing requirements: (1) scalability is typically achieved by relaxing consistency; (2) fault-tolerance is typically achieved through the consistent replication of state machines. Adding nodes to a system can therefore either increase performance at the expense of consistency, or increase resiliency at the expense of performance.We propose HovercRaft, a new approach by which adding nodes increases both the resilience and the performance of general-purpose state-machine replication. We achieve this through an extension of the Raft protocol that carefully eliminates CPU and I/O bottlenecks and load balances requests.Our implementation uses state-of-the-art kernel-bypass techniques, datacenter transport protocols, and in-network programmability to deliver up to 1 million operations/second for clusters of up to 9 nodes, linear speedup over unreplicated configuration for selected workloads, and a 4X speedup for the YCSBE-E benchmark running on Redis over an unreplicated deployment.},

abstract = {A blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology where transactions as data state changes are permanently recorded securely and transparently without the need for third parties. Besides, introducing smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability, revolutionizing the software ecosystem toward decentralized applications. Although promising, the usability of smart contracts is primarily limited to on-chain data without access to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events reside. This connectability to off-chain data for smart contracts and blockchain is an open practical problem referred to as the “oracle problem” and is defined as how real-world data can be transferred into/from the blockchain. Hence, Blockchain oracles are introduced and implemented in the form of application programming interfaces connecting the real world to the blockchain for mitigating such a limitation. This article studies and analyzes how blockchain oracles provide final feedback (i.e., outcome) to smart contracts and survey blockchain oracle technologies and mechanisms regarding data integrity and correctness. Since the existing solutions are extensive in terms of characteristics and usage, we investigate their structure and principles by classifying the blockchain oracle implementation techniques into two major groups voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on participants’ stakes for outcome finalization, while the latter considers reputation and performance metrics in conjunction with authenticity-proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We present the result of this classification with a thorough discussion of the state of the art and provide the remaining challenges and future research directions in the end.},

Here, we provide an in-depth longitudinal view of Internet traffic during 5 years (from 2013 to 2017). We take the point of the view of a national-wide ISP and analyze rich flow-level measurements to pinpoint and quantify changes. We observe the traffic, both from a point of view of users and services. We show that an ordinary broadband subscriber downloaded in 2017 more than twice as much as they used to do 5 years before. Bandwidth hungry video services drove this change at the beginning, while recently social messaging applications contribute to increase of data consumption. We study how protocols and service infrastructures evolve over time, highlighting events that may challenge traffic management policies. In the rush to bring servers closer and closer to users, we witness the birth of the sub-millisecond Internet, with caches located directly at ISP edges. The picture we take shows a lively Internet that always evolves and suddenly changes.

abstract = {Software-defined networks offer flexible and intelligent network operations by splitting a traditional network into a centralized control plane and a programmable data plane. The controller in the control plane is the fundamental element used to manage all operations of the data plane. Hence, the performance and capabilities of the controller itself are essential in achieving optimal performance. Furthermore, the tools used to benchmark their performance must be accurate and useful in measuring different evaluation parameters. There are dozens of controller proposals for general and specialized networks in the literature. However, there is a very limited comprehensive quantitative analysis for them. In this article, we present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of different SDN controllers, along with a quantitative analysis of their performance in different network scenarios. We categorize and classify 34 controllers and present a qualitative comparison. We also present a comparative analysis of controllers for specialized networks such as the Internet of Things, blockchain networks, vehicular networks, and wireless sensor networks. We also discuss in-depth capabilities of benchmarking tools and provide a comparative analysis of their capabilities. This work uses three benchmarking tools to compare 9 controllers and presents a detailed analysis of their performance, along with discussion on performance of specialized network controllers.},

abstract = {The devices forming Internet of Things (IoT) networks need to be re-programmed over the air, so that new features are added, software bugs or security vulnerabilities are resolved, and their applications can be re-purposed. The limitations of IoT devices, such as installation in locations with limited physical access, resource-constrained nature, large scale, and high heterogeneity, should be taken into consideration for designing an efficient and reliable pipeline for over-the-air programming (OTAP). In this work, we present a survey of OTAP techniques, which can be applied to IoT networks. We highlight the main challenges and limitations of OTAP for IoT devices and analyze the essential steps of the firmware update process, along with different approaches and techniques that implement them. In addition, we discuss schemes that focus on securing the OTAP process. Finally, we present a collection of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial platforms that integrate secure and reliable OTAP.},

abstract = {The adoption of network traffic encryption is continually growing. Popular applications use encryption protocols to secure communications and protect the privacy of users. In addition, a large portion of malware is spread through the network traffic taking advantage of encryption protocols to hide its presence and activity. Entering into the era of completely encrypted communications over the Internet, we must rapidly start reviewing the state-of-the-art in the wide domain of network traffic analysis and inspection, to conclude if traditional traffic processing systems will be able to seamlessly adapt to the upcoming full adoption of network encryption. In this survey, we examine the literature that deals with network traffic analysis and inspection after the ascent of encryption in communication channels. We notice that the research community has already started proposing solutions on how to perform inspection even when the network traffic is encrypted and we demonstrate and review these works. In addition, we present the techniques and methods that these works use and their limitations. Finally, we examine the countermeasures that have been proposed in the literature in order to circumvent traffic analysis techniques that aim to harm user privacy.},

abstract = {When Sir Tim Berners-Lee first proposed the foundations of the World Wide Web at CERN in 1989, his manager called it “vague, but exciting.” How things have changed since then! Twenty-six years later, Berners-Lee won the ACM Turing Award “for inventing the World Wide Web, the first Web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale.” This book is a compilation of articles on the original ideas of a true visionary and the subsequent research and development work he has led, helping to realize the Web’s full potential. It is intended for readers interested in the Web’s original technical development, how it has changed over time, and the social impacts of the Web as steered by Berners-Lee since the very beginning.The book covers Berners-Lee's development of the key protocols, naming schemes, and markup languages that led to his “world wide web” program and ultimately to the Web as we know it today. His early efforts were refined as Web technology spread around the world, and he was further guided by the work of the World Wide Web Consortium, which he founded and still directs. He was instrumental in the conceptualization and realization of the Semantic Web, a field that is gaining momentum in the age of big data and knowledge graphs; was a driving force for the field of Web Science, a new and growing research area dedicated to the study of both the engineering and the impacts of the Web; and he continues to innovate through his research work at MIT on open and decentralized information. Berners-Lee is also known for his contributions to keeping the Web open and ubiquitous via his work with the World Wide Web Foundation, the UK's Open Data Institute and his recent call for a crowdsourced magna carta for the Web. This book will help the reader to understand how Sir Tim’s invention of the World Wide Web has revolutionized not just Computer Science, but global society itself.}

abstract = {As recently as 1968, computer scientists were uncertain how best to interconnect even two computers. The notion that within a few decades the challenge would be how to interconnect millions of computers around the globe was too far-fetched to contemplate. Yet, by 1988, that is precisely what was happening. The products and devices developed in the intervening years—such as modems, multiplexers, local area networks, and routers—became the linchpins of the global digital society. How did such revolutionary innovation occur? This book tells the story of the entrepreneurs who were able to harness and join two factors: the energy of computer science researchers supported by governments and universities, and the tremendous commercial demand for Internetworking computers. The centerpiece of this history comes from unpublished interviews from the late 1980s with over 80 computing industry pioneers, including Paul Baran, J.C.R. Licklider, Vint Cerf, Robert Kahn, Larry Roberts, and Robert Metcalfe. These individuals give us unique insights into the creation of multi-billion dollar markets for computer-communications equipment, and they reveal how entrepreneurs struggled with failure, uncertainty, and the limits of knowledge.“The key technologies that brought us our modern networked society—routers, packet switching, multiplexers, Internet protocols—were all invented by people in the short period between 1968 and 1988. James Pelkey interviewed these people at that time and recorded their stories. This book is the result: a detailed and up-close personal history of a world being born. Fascinating.” - W. Brian Arthur, Author of The Nature of Technology: What It Is and How It Evolves“Circuits, Packets, and Protocols is full of revelations for me even though I was there. Never had it explained so clearly how my distributed computing strategy was the wrong one for 3Com in the 1980s.” - Bob Metcalfe, Internet Pioneer, Ethernet inventor, 3Com founder; University of Texas at Austin Professor of Innovation}

The initial concept was established by the two co-founders, Elisa Bertino and Ravi Sandhu, and sharpened by subsequent discussions with several fellow data security and privacy researchers. Their enthusiastic encouragement persuaded the co-founders to move ahead with the always daunting task of creating a high-quality conference. CODASPY has become a leading forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on hardware and software security. The conference gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of data and applications security and privacy.This year, the call for papers attracted 165 submissions from 32 different countries, resulting in accepted papers from Asia, Europe, and North America. The submitted papers were peer reviewed and subsequently discussed based on their novelty, quality, and contribution by the members of the Program Committee. The submissions were double blind, and all the members of the Program Committee had access to all the submissions and their reviews at all times to facilitate discussion among the members. The submission and the review process were done using Easychair, a web-based software system. Based on the reviews and discussion, 31 Full Research Papers and 8 Dataset/Tool papers were accepted of the 165 total submissions for an overall acceptance rate of 23%.},

abstract = {We are delighted to introduce the first volume of the ASPLOS proceedings for 2025. The conference is in its third year of an experiment with a three-deadline structure: authors can submit to any of three separate review cycles handled by a single year-long program committee. This volume includes papers from the first two review cycles, which had submission deadlines in the spring and summer of 2024. We combined the two cycles because submission volumes in the spring cycle were disproportionately small.This volume contains 72 of the 74 papers accepted to ASPLOS 2025 to date. This includes papers accepted in the spring and summer cycles and those invited to submit a revision in the spring cycle that was ultimately accepted. Two of these 74 accepted papers are still undergoing artifact evaluation and will be published in a subsequent volume. The spring and summer review cycles saw a combined 586 submissions. These submissions were reviewed by a 208-person Program Committee augmented by 57 External Review Committee members. On occasion, we solicited a small number of external expert reviews. On the PC, 129 members self-reported they were in an academic role and 77 self-reported they were in an industrial role. On the ERC it was 43 and 13 respectively. The median PhD year of the combined committees was 2014. In addition to these committees, we engaged ten vice chairs, experienced and trusted reviewers who helped us monitor the review process for each paper.These committees reviewed all of the submissions that were not desk rejected (11 papers) or withdrawn (4 papers). In keeping with recent norms, the technical review happened in two phases. Each paper received three reviews in the first round, with, in most cases, two additional reviews in the second round for the 54% of submissions that advanced. To assign reviews, we used the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to provide a preliminary review assignment that matched reviewer expertise. We then manually inspected and adjusted these assignments as needed: for example, to correct errors in TPMS's topic modeling or adjust to late-discovered conflicts. In addition, each paper was assigned a non-conflicted chair and a non-conflicted vice chair to provide two extra sets of eyes to monitor and facilitate the process. Due to the size and distribution of the PC, which spanned 14 time zones, the PC did not meet synchronously. Instead, each paper was discussed by the reviewers via comments in the HotCRP system. Ultimately, the discussion for each paper reached one of three outcomes: rejection, conditional acceptance, or major revision. All conditionally accepted papers were shepherded. Major revision papers were invited to revise and resubmit their paper for a second round of review by a subset of the original reviewers. All authors of papers that advanced to the second round of review were given the opportunity to see and respond to their reviewer questions prior to the reviewer discussion.},

AAMAS is the flagship conference of the non-profit International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS).We are happy that the 2025 edition of AAMAS will be coming to Detroit, MI. Previous editions were held in Bologna (2002), Melbourne (2003), New York (2004), Utrecht (2005), Hakodate (2006), Honolulu (2007), Estoril (2008), Budapest (2009), Toronto (2010), Taipei (2011), Valencia (2012), Saint Paul (2013), Paris (2014), Istanbul (2015), Singapore (2016), S\~{a}o Paulo (2017), Stockholm (2018), Montr\'{e}al (2019), Auckland/online (2020), London/online (2021), Auckland/online (2022), London (2023), and Auckland (2024).The main track of the conference includes peer-reviewed technical papers describing significant and original research on all aspects of the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems, divided into the following areas of interest:Learning and Adaptation (LEARN)Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP)Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE)Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS)Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR)Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS)Modeling and Simulation of Societies (SIM)Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)Robotics and Control (ROBOT)Innovative Applications (IA)As in previous years, we worked with a three-tier program committee, consisting of 29 area chairs, 147 senior program committee members, and over 600 regular program committee members. Their work was supported by a substantial number of auxiliary reviewers. When composing the committee, we followed the tradition of AAMAS of not having anyone serve in a senior programme committee or area chair role for more than two years in a row, and we were pleased to see that many senior colleagues accepted our invitation to serve as regular programme committee members.For the main track, we received a total of 1361 abstract submissions. Some didn't materialize while a number of others were desk-rejected (mostly due to anonymity violations and similar infringements of the rules laid down in the Call for Papers). The program committee then reviewed the remaining 1021 submissions. Almost all submissions received at least three reviews, as well as a meta-review summarizing the assessment of the program committee. Authors had the opportunity to respond to initial versions of their reviews during a rebuttal phase, and the rebuttal phase additional gave the authors and reviewers an opportunity to engage in further discussion.},

abstract = {Welcome to the third volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. This document is mostly dedicated to the 2024 fall cycle but also provides some statistics summarizing all three cycles.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, most of which were discussed in our previous messages from program chairs in Volume 1 and 2, including: (1) significantly increasing the program committee size to over 220 members (more than twice the size of last year); (2) foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings and instead making all decisions online; (3) overhauling the review assignment process; (4) developing an automated submission format violation identifier script that uncovers, e.g., disallowed vertical space manipulations that "squeeze" space; (5) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee; and (6) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Assuming readers have read our previous messages, here, we will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous ones. These include: (1) Finally unifying submission and acceptance paper formatting instructions (forgoing the `jpaper' class) to rid authors of accepted papers from the need to reformat; (2) Describing the methodology we employed to select best papers, which we believe ensures quality and hope will persist; and (3) Reporting the ethical incidents we encountered and how we handled them. In the final, fourth volume, when the outcome of the ASPLOS'24 fall major revisions will become known, we plan to conduct a broader analysis of all the data we have gathered throughout the year.Following are some key statistics of the fall cycle: 340 submissions were finalized (43% more than last year's fall count and 17% less than our summer cycle) of which 111 are related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 105 to machine learning, 54 to security, 50 to datacenter/cloud and 50 to storage/memory; 183 (54%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 39 (11.5%) papers were accepted (of which 19 were awarded artifact evaluation badges); 33 (9.7%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions and are currently under review (these will be addressed in the fourth volume of ASPLOS'24 and will be presented in ASPLOS'25 if accepted); 1,368 reviews were uploaded; and 4,949 comments were generated during online discussions, of which 4,070 were dedicated to the submissions that made it to the second review round.This year, in the submission form, we asked authors to specify which of the three ASPLOS research areas are related to their submitted work. Analyzing this data revealed that 80%, 39%, and 29% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, generating the highest difference we have observed across the cycles between architecture and the other two. About 46% of the fall submissions are "interdisciplinary," namely, were associated with two or more of the three areas.Overall, throughout all the ASPLOS'24 cycles, we received 922 submissions, constituting a 1.54x increase compared to last year. Our reviewers submitted a total of 3,634 reviews containing more than 2.6 million words, and we also generated 12,655 online comments consisting of nearly 1.2 million words. As planned, PC members submitted an average of 15.7 reviews and a median of 15, and external review committee (ERC) members submitted an average of 4.7 and a median of 5.We accepted 170 papers thus far, written by 1100 authors, leading to an 18.4% acceptance rate, with the aforementioned 33 major revisions still under review. Assuming that the revision acceptance rate will be similar to that of previous cycles, we estimate that ASPLOS'24 will accept nearly 200 (!) papers, namely, 21%–22% of the submissions.The ASPLOS'24 program consists of 193 papers: the 170 papers we accepted thus far and, in addition, 23 major revisions from the fall cycle of ASPLOS'23, which were re-reviewed and accepted. The full details are available in the PDF of the front matter.},

For this volume of ASPLOS ’23, we discontinued the use of the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS ’21 and ASPLOS ’22. We found the extended abstract offered limited filtering and moved to a more traditional two phase review process. Each paper received 3 reviews in phase 1 and papers with positive scores advanced to the second round and received up to 2 more reviews. In our preface to Volume III, we will give a more detailed rundown of how the process worked.},

We believe that holding the conference in person offers significant advantages, including richer opportunities for direct engagement and networking, a more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and a more welcoming environment for newcomers. To accommodate those who, in exceptional cases, are unable to attend in person, we have arranged for the option of proxy presenters (i.e. a qualified person presents on their behalf).This year's conference spans six days, beginning with a day dedicated to the Doctoral Consortium and Tutorial presentations. The following three days feature sessions comprising three Keynote Talks, full papers, short papers, resource and reproducibility papers, perspective papers, lowresources environments papers, system demonstrations, and an industry track (SIRIP). The program also features two Women in IR (WIR) activities (a panel and a poster session). Finally, the last day is devoted to Workshops aimed at fostering discussion and encouraging collaboration on emerging research topics in Information Retrieval, as well as to the LiveRag challenge, organized by the Technology Innovation Institute, and focused on Retrieval Augmented Generation. On Friday the 18th the ICTIR 2025 Conference takes place.Social highlights include a welcome reception, a conference dinner, a student luncheon and student party, as well as the WIR reception and the ICTIR Social Dinner.The SIGIR 2025 technical program is highlighted by three keynote presentations delivered by esteemed speakers, to whom we extend our sincere gratitude: Stephen Robertson (Girton College, Cambridge, UK), Iryna Gurevych (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany), and Ophir Frieder (Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA).},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multimedia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},
