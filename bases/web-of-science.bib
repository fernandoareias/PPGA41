Abstract = {Nowadays, a far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) system aims to
   deliver wireless power over a distance of a few meters. Communication
   among devices for the purpose of WPT in the far-field WPT system is
   unique as its purpose is to establish, maintain and monitor a WPT
   session among devices in the system. For proper functionality of a WPT
   system, a number of communication-, control- and management-related
   challenges need to be addressed. Hence, here an application layer
   protocol specifically designed for a WPT system is presented. The
   protocol provides essential control, management and communication
   functionalities to establish, maintain and monitor a WPT session. Some
   features of a WPT system require low-latency communication, hence
   enhancements for a networking protocol stack are also proposed. To
   validate the effectiveness of the presented application layer protocol
   along with the enhancements proposed for the networking protocol stack,
   a set of experiments was carried out over a real WPT system. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocol possesses
   the features essential for a WPT system, and the proposed enhancements
   for the networking protocol stack provide low-latency communication
   along with lower control overhead compared with an existing
   state-of-the-art network protocol stack.},

Abstract = {Search and rescue (SaR) robotics is a fast-growing domain of academic
   research and field applications. Robots are widely used in various tasks
   before, during and after a disaster outbreak. SaR missions require fast
   hardware deployment, should rely on robust systems and tend employing
   groups of collaborating robots, which increase overall system
   performance and reliability. Heterogeneous robotic group connectivity
   demands a unified way of communication, which could be used by robots
   with different hardware and software. Such communication protocol should
   be open source and flexible enough to be applicable in international SaR
   missions. In this paper, we present a new protocol for heterogeneous
   robots' interaction within a SaR mission. The proposed application layer
   protocol is based on well-tested modern technologies and implements the
   above-listed features that make it applicable in practice. The protocol
   is extendable, flexible and outperforms previously developed SaR
   robotics interaction protocols since it considers advantages,
   disadvantages and implementation difficulties that had been faced by the
   previously suggested protocols. The protocol was experimentally
   validated in a joint mapping task within a laboratory environment.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are demonstrating a significant
   impact in various sectors. These solutions encompass diverse
   applications, ranging from machine-tomachine communication to
   human-to-machine interaction within the same system. Various types of
   IoT application protocols have been developed to address these needs.
   While some IoT protocols enable direct communication between devices,
   others rely on server-based communication. Both forms of communication
   can coexist within the same IoT solution. However, utilizing multiple
   protocols in low-capacity IoT nodes can result in performance
   degradation. In this study, an adaptive protocol is proposed, which
   combines server-based and direct access protocols. This study also
   explains the working principle of the proposed protocol and compares its
   functionality with MATT using OPNET and real environment. It was
   observed that the proposed protocol remained functional even in the
   event of a server failure. Furthermore, the protocol was found to be
   efficient in terms of bandwidth usage. Conversely, it exhibited lower
   latency in the direct communication method. Although the proposed
   protocol had slightly higher latency in server-based communication, it
   remained operational.},

Abstract = {The real-time characteristics of modular systems have been a long
   sought-after goal in many industries including automotive, aeronautics
   or mobile robotics. Yet scientists and practitioners are still
   struggling to find widespread implementation solutions that may
   accommodate diverse inter -modular real-time communication requirements.
   In an attempt to cover this research gap, the current paper proposes a
   real-time version of the PARSECS protocol for low -end devices. Our new
   protocol, coined as PARSECS\_RT, was designed according to Open Systems
   Interconnection Reference Model. It offers a full communication stack
   from the physical layer to the application layer on top of the SPI
   interface in order to provide a stable, hard real-time communication
   platform. PARSECS\_RT was evaluated in real and simulated environments
   providing promising results.},

Abstract = {Many contemporary applications employ the application layer protocol
   Know as HTTP. HTTP/3 stands as the latest oficial version, standarized
   in August 2020, evolved from HTTP/2, an built upon the QUIC transport
   protocol. HTTP/3 was devised to improve the performance and efficiency
   of web communications, especially in network environments Characterized
   by hight packet loss and connection fluctuations.QUIC is a user-level
   protocol that runs over UDP to overcome some of the limitations and
   disadvantages of TCP in the context of web communications. By using UDP,
   QUIC offers advantages such as lower latency, increased efficiency in
   networks with high packet loss, and the ability to establish faster
   connections.The aim of this document is to provide an overview of
   Google's QUIC protocol proposal, and an analysis of the performance
   evaluations made of HTTP/3 using QUIC. Finally, the protocol's design
   and the mechanisms employed, encompassing flow control, congestion
   control, security, and multiplexing, will be described.},
