  abstract={Communications and communication protocols play an important role in mobile robotic systems (MRS). Addressing real-time mobile robot applications, MRS should communicate with minimal effort and resources, dealing with long delays and any losses incurred. In a swarm scenario implementing a stack of communication protocols becomes a key factor for both the performance and the regular operation. The paper aims to review the most widely used application layer protocols for swarm robot scenarios. These protocols are the short publish-subscribe message protocols available for application layer communication (ALC). In the paper, we present specific design guidelines for the pipeline architecture implementing MAVLink, DDS-XRCE, and rosserial application protocols (SALP) in an event-driven realtime communication channel. The shown pipelines architecture is a conceptual model for hybrid and cluster-based distributed fault-tolerant networks using a zero-copy shared memory approach with over inter-process-communication (IPC).},

  abstract={According to the problem of a more urgent need for the efficiency network protocols that because of the satellite communication is gradually moving towards network with the development of space technology, design a lightweight inter-satellite network protocol for inter-satellite links. The lightweight inter-satellite network protocol includes inter-satellite network protocol system and inter-satellite routing protocol. The inter-satellite network protocol system dominates the transmission of data, and its effective data rate directly affects the transmission efficiency. The inter-satellite routing protocol realizes the perception of topology changes of the whole network nodes through interactive routing information packets, and realizes efficient addressing. By compressing the header content to optimize transport protocol format and control protocol overhead, this can achieve high-efficiency transmission, the effective application data proportion up to 80% or more. Tailor and accelerate convergence traditional dynamic routing protocol based on interplanetary network characteristics, reduce the header overhead by bit mapping, reduce packet content by replacing redundant address by short link-type, add the routing packet sending mechanism triggered by topology changes to design lightweight dynamic routing protocol which is robust, low overhead and rapid convergence. The optimized routing protocol packet cost is reduced by about 75%. Verified by simulation, the lightweight inter-satellite network protocol can give priority to ensuring service connectivity in the case of extreme link bandwidth, and the routing convergence time is reduced by about 95%. The lightweight inter-satellite network protocol can provide an efficient, simple and reliable network protocol solution for communication of narrow bandwidth inter-satellite link and other application fields in our country.},

  abstract={In this paper Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED) that use ethernet for communicating with substation devices on the grid where modelled in OPNET. There is a need to test the communication protocol performance over the network. A model for the substation communication network was implemented in OPNET. This was done for ESKOM, which is the electrical power generation and distribution authority in South Africa. The substation communication model consists of 10 ethernet nodes which simulate protection Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), 13 ethernet switches, a server which simulates the substation Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) and the DNP3 Protocol over TCP/IP simulated on the model. DNP3 is a protocol that can be used in a power utility computer network to provide communication service for the grid components. It was selected as the communication protocol because it is widely used in the energy sector in South Africa. The network load and packet delay parameters were sampled when 10%, 50%, 90% and 100% of devices are online. Analysis of the results showed that with an increase in number of nodes there was an increase in packet delay as well as the network load. The load on the network should be taken into consideration when designing a substation communication network that requires a quick response such as a smart gird.},

  abstract={This paper investigates path planning algorithms and network protocols for multi-UAV collaborative coverage tasks, with the goal of enhancing coordination efficiency in complex missions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-UAV path planning within known environments, this study addresses the challenge of multi-UAV coverage path planning in unknown environments. A novel algorithm, PL-MUSTC, based on the principles of parallel lines and spanning tree algorithms, is proposed to mitigate issues of redundant coverage along obstacle edges and target area boundaries, thereby significantly reducing task completion time. Additionally, to address communication constraints among UAVs, the MUCTAP application-layer protocol is designed. This protocol ensures that UAVs can effectively accomplish tasks even under limited communication conditions and includes strategies for handling node failures. Simulation results validate the applicability of the PL-MUSTC algorithm and the robustness of the MUCTAP protocol, demonstrating that this approach can effectively enhance task efficiency and coverage in unknown environments.},

This paper undertakes an examination of the information flow within the WSNs Convention stack and puts forth a modified version of the stack. In comparison to the current WSNs Convention stack, this adapted version aims to achieve reductions in energy consumption, overall communication delay, and system failures. To cater effectively to the distinctive requirements of WSNs, the proposed protocol stack incorporates a resource sharing controller, tasked with optimizing resource allocation across all stack levels. This approach seeks to curtail packet loss during communication while upholding flow control. Through the strategic alignment of each layer’s functions with the available resources, this methodology effectively mitigates energy usage concerns.},

  abstract={Global tensions highlight the critical role of communications for both state and non-state organizations. Consequently, the emerging field of maritime, particularly underwater communications, is poised to gain significance. This philosophy is highlighted by the standardization of protocols such as JANUS by NATO. Introducing an IP adaptation layer, such as IPv6, for underwater communications seems intuitive but requires adaptations due to the constraints of the underwater environment, especially in terms of security. By examining the relevance of protocols like DTLS coupled with SCHC, which combine network header compression and datagram security, we have defined a balance between security and bandwidth limitations for underwater sensor networks. We mainly validate the feasibility of our design through simulations conducted on personal computing systems, which replicate the communication protocols and data translation within a controlled environment. This step ensures our approach's viability before potential future implementation on prototype acoustic modems. Therefore, this work aims to underline the advancements in secure underwater communication protocols, offering insights into their design, challenges, and potential impacts on ocean engineering, ecosystem monitoring, and maritime cybersecurity.},

  abstract={Semantic communication has recently attracted considerable attention, mainly motivated by the trend of developing “task-oriented” communication solutions that tailor resource consumption to the task at hand. Despite the general intuition that semantic communication may contribute to more efficient system design, there have been only a few concrete attempts to implement aspects of it in practice. To help bridge this gap, in this paper, we revisit the theoretical foundations of semantic communication and address the possible implications on the protocol and system design. The focus is on two perspectives of semantic communication: (i) a goal-oriented perspective, which unifies aspects of traffic generation, communication, and control, with emphasis on the definition of appropriate semantic-aware metrics, and (ii) a semantic operability perspective, which extends the notion of data exchange through standardized interfaces (interoperability), to include the meaning or, more generally, the significance of data. We discuss applications of the concepts in scenarios such as robotic control and health monitoring.},

  abstract={Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain technology has had a significant impact on many fields. The lack of effective communication between heterogeneous and isolated blockchains, however, restricts the promotion and ecological development of blockchain industry. In this context, crosschain technology has rapidly developed and become a new research hotspot. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain and the complexity of crosschain scenarios, crosschain technology faces huge security risks. In this paper, we propose formal analysis of the IBC protocol, one of the most popular crosschain communication protocols, aiming to help developers design and implement crosschain technologies more securely. We formalize three main components of the IBC protocol with TLA+, a temporal logic specification language, and verify some important requirements with model checking tool TLC. The verification results are analyzed comprehensively. Issues found through our formal analysis have been reported to the community, most of which have been acknowledged. We also propose some recommendations for removing potential risks.},

  abstract={Traditional Internet is focused in communicating people. In contrast, in the Internet of Things (IoT), devices or things communicate among them. However, these devices are usually constrained in terms of processing, storage, batteries, and transmission power. Such limitations have led to reconsider the use of widely used protocols on Internet and to create new protocols designed to constrained scenarios. Although, HTTP, one of the well-known and most used on the Internet application layer protocol, was not designed for constrained scenarios; currently, it is highly used on the IoT. Considering this, it is necessary to adapt the protocol to the restricted scenarios to achieve its properly work with an acceptable performance. In this work, we took HTTP/2, the most recent version of the protocol, as a basis to propose a flow control algorithm oriented to IoT. Through mathematical modeling and simulations, we compare our proposal with another generic and not IoT-oriented flow control algorithm for HTTP/2, NGHTTP/2. The results showed that the proposed algorithm decreased overhead between 25% and 69% in all scenarios. In terms of throughput the results were mixed, in two of three scenarios the reference algorithm was between 3% and 13% faster. In the remaining scenario the throughput was very similar.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In space-based communications, the need for an advanced protocol stack capable of managing diverse traffic classes and varying latencies is of great importance. This paper introduces a novel protocol stack designed to support low-latency applications in space networks. At the core of our proposed solution lies the modification of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol and the implementation of a priority queue system, specifically designed with individual queues to efficiently accommodate varying traffic classes and their respective priorities. The first queue is dedicated to highly deterministic traffic, crucial for high-priority applications, ensuring end-to-end latency is kept below $\mathbf{100}\ \mu \mathbf{s}$. The second queue manages moderately deterministic traffic, targeting a latency requirement of 4 ms. The third queue is designed for non-deterministic traffic, catering to less time-sensitive data transmissions. This approach to MAC protocol adaptation not only meets the diverse requirements of space-based network traffic but also sets a new standard for achieving low-latency communications in challenging environments.},

  abstract={Concomitant with the rapid development of network communications technology, the analysis of communication protocols has become indispensable in the maintenance of daily network security. Common protocol analysis methods predominantly analyze protocols using known information, such as fixed port numbers; however, these methods have significant limitations. In the current network environment, the proportion of undisclosed protocols is increasing daily, and the information related to such protocols is difficult to obtain and sometimes fails because of the particularity of the unknown protocol format. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze unknown protocols in the context of less prior knowledge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel protocol identification method in which association analysis and identification of unknown bitstream protocols are first carried out based on composite feature sets. Furthermore, data mining and statistics-related knowledge are applied to realize protocol message-type identification and protocol message-format analysis. The results of experiments conducted on the bitstream protocol dataset verify that the proposed method can accurately identify different message types. Specifically, taking the ICMP and ARP protocols as examples, the proposed method could effectively infer the main features, which is helpful for further protocol information extraction and analysis.},

  abstract={The wireless air interface is open and accessible to both authorized and unauthorized users due to the broadcast nature of radio propagation. In a wired network, communication equipment is connected via wires, and a station without a direct link is unable to connect to the network for illicit reasons. Wireless transmissions are more vulnerable to malicious assaults than wired transmissions due to the open communications environment, which includes both passive and active attackers for disrupting valid signals. First, we’ll go through wireless network security needs. Following that, a complete review of security assaults in wireless networks is provided, with potential security risks examined at each protocol layer, in light of the network protocol design. Finally, certain technological problems that have yet to be overcome at the time of writing are outlined, as well as anticipated developments in wireless security.},
